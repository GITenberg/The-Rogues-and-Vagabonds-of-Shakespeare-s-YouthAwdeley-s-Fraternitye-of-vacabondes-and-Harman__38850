<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr />
<p>If the ways and slang of Vagabonds and Beggars interested
Martin Luther enough to make him write a preface to the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
in 1528, two of the ungodly may be excused for caring, in
1869, for the old Rogues of their English land, and for putting
together three of the earliest tracts about them. Moreover, these
tracts are part of the illustrative matter that we want round our great
book on Elizabethan England, Harrison's <i>Description of Britain</i>, and
the chief of them is quoted by the excellent parson who wrote that
book.</p>

<p>The first of these three tracts, Awdeley's <i>Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i>,
has been treated by many hasty bibliographers, who can never
have taken the trouble to read the first three leaves of Harman's
book, as later than, and a mere pilfering from, Harman's <i>Caueat</i>. No
such accusation, however, did Harman himself bring against the
worthy printer-author (herein like printer-author Crowley, though he
was preacher too,) who preceded him. In his Epistle dedicatory to
the Countes of Shrewsbury, p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>, below, Harman, after speaking
of 'these wyly wanderers,' vagabonds, says in 1566 or 1567,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was <i>a fewe yeares since</i> a small bréefe setforth of some zelous
man to his countrey,&mdash;of whom I knowe not,&mdash;that made a lytle shewe
of there names and vsage, and gaue a glymsinge lyghte, not sufficient
to perswade of their peuishe peltinge and pickinge practyses, but well
worthy of prayse.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">AWDELEY'S <i>FRATERNITYE OF VACABONDES</i>.</div>

<p>This description of the 'small bréefe,' and the 'lytle shewe' of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">ii</a></span>
the 'names and vsage,' exactly suits Awdeley's tract; and the 'fewe
yeares since' also suits the date of what may be safely assumed to
be the first edition of the <i>Fraternitye</i>, by John Awdeley or John
Sampson, or Sampson Awdeley,&mdash;for by all these names, says Mr
Payne Collier, was our one man known:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It may be disputed whether this printer's name were really Sampson,
or Awdeley: he was made free of the Stationers' Company as Sampson,
and so he is most frequently termed towards the commencement of the
Register; but he certainly wrote and printed his name Awdeley or
Awdelay; now and then it stands in the Register 'Sampson Awdeley.'
It is the more important to settle the point, because ... he was not
only a printer, but a versifier,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and ought to have been included by
Ritson in his <i>Bibliographica Poetica</i>. (Registers of the Stationers' Company,
<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1848, vol. i. p. 23.)</p></div>

<p>These verses of Awdeley's, or Sampson's, no doubt led to his
'small bréefe' being entered in the Stationers' Register as a 'ballett':</p>
<div class="blockquotn">
<p class="noi">"1560-1. Rd. of John Sampson, for his lycense for pryntinge
of a ballett called the description of vakaboundes ... iiij<sup>d</sup>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"[This entry seems to refer to an early edition of a very curious work,
printed again by Sampson, alias Awdeley, in 1565, when it bore the
following title, 'The fraternitie of vacabondes, as well of rufling vacabones
as of beggerly, <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>as well of women as of men, <a name="FNanchor_3a_3a" id="FNanchor_3a_3a"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>and as well of
gyrles as of boyes, with their proper names and qualityes. Also the
xxv. orders of knaves, otherwise called a quartten of knawes. Confirmed
this yere by Cocke Lorel.' The edition without date mentioned
by Dibdin (iv. 564) may have been that of the entry. Another impression
by Awdeley, dated 1575 [which we reprint] is reviewed in the
<i>British Bibliographer</i>, ii. 12, where it is asserted (as is very probable,
though we are without distinct evidence of the fact) that the printer
was the compiler of the book, and he certainly introduces it by three
six-line stanzas. If this work came out originally in 1561, according
to the entry, there is no doubt that it was the precursor of a very
singular series of tracts on the same subject, which will be noticed in
their proper places.]"&mdash;J. P. Collier, <i>Registers</i>, i. 42.</p></div>

<p>As above said, I take Harman's 'fewe yeares'&mdash;in 1566 or 7&mdash;to
point to the 1561 edition of Awdeley, and not the 1565 ed. And as to
Awdeley's authorship,&mdash;what can be more express than his own words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">iii</a></span>p. <a href="#Page_2b">2</a>, below, that what the Vagabond caught at a Session confest as to
'both names and states of most and least of this their Vacabondes
brotherhood,' <i>that</i>,&mdash;'at the request of a worshipful man, I ['The
Printer,' that is, John Awdeley] have set it forth as well as I can.'</p>

<p>But if a doubt on Awdeley's priority to Harman exists in any
reader's mind, let him consider this second reference by Harman to
Awdeley (p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, below), not noticed by the bibliographers: "For-as-much
as these two names, a Iarkeman and a Patrico, bée in <i>the
old briefe of vacabonds</i>, and set forth as two kyndes of euil doers,
you shall vnderstande that a Iarkeman hath his name of a <i>Iarke,
which is a seale in their Language</i>, as one should <i>make writinges and
set seales for lycences</i> and pasporte," and then turn to Awdeley's
<i>Fraternitye of Vacabondes</i>, and there see, at page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, below:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h6>¶ A IACK MAN.</h6>

<p>A Iackeman is he that can write and reade, and sometime speake latin.
He vseth <i>to make counterfaite licences</i> which they call Gybes, <i>and sets to
Seales, in their language called Iarkes</i>. (See also 'A Whipiacke,' p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>.)</p></div>

<p>Let the reader then compare Harman's own description of a
<i>Patrico</i>, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, with that in 'the old <i>Briefe of Vacabonds</i>,' Awdeley,
p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>:</p>
<div class="table">
<table summary="description of a Patrico">
<tr>
<td class="center">Awdeley.</td>
<td class="center">Harman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">¶ A <span class="smcap">Patriarke Co.</span></td>
<td class="center">there is a <span class="smcap">Patrico</span> ...</td>

<td>

&amp; that is <i>vntill death
depart</i> the maried folke.</td>
<td>
whiche in their language is a priest,
that should <i>make mariages tyll
death dyd depart</i>.</td></tr></table></div>

<p class="noi">And surely no doubt on the point will remain in his mind, though,
if needed, a few more confirmations could be got, as</p>

<div class="table">
<table summary="description of a Patrico" cellspacing="5">
<tr>
<td class="center">Awdeley (p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>).</td>

<td class="center">Harman (p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">¶ A <span class="smcap">Palliard</span>.</td>
<td class="center">¶ A Pallyard.</td>

patched cloke, and hys Doxy
goeth in like apparell.
</td>
<td>
These Palliardes ... go with patched
clokes, and haue their Morts with
them.</td></tr></table></div>

<p>We may conclude, then, certainly, that Awdeley did not plagiarize
Harman; and probably, that he first published his <i>Fraternitye</i> in
1561. The tract is a mere sketch, as compared with Harman's
<i>Caueat</i>, though in its descriptions (p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>-<a href="#Page_11">11</a>) of 'A Curtesy Man,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">HARMAN'S <i>CAUEAT</i>: THE EARLY EDITIONS.</span>'A Cheatour or Fingerer,' and 'A Ring-Faller' (one of whom tried
his tricks on me in Gower-street about ten days ago), it gives as full
a picture as Harman does of the general run of his characters. The
edition of 1575 being the only one accessible to us, our trusty Oxford
copier, Mr George Parker, has read the proofs with the copy in the
Bodleian.</p>

<p>Let no one bring a charge of plagiarizing Awdeley, against Harman,
for the latter, as has been shown, referred fairly to Awdeley's
'<i>small breefe</i>' or '<i>old briefe of vacabonds</i>,' and wrote his own "bolde
Beggars booke" (p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>) from his own long experience with them.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p>Harman's <i>Caueat</i> is too well-known and widely valued a book
to need description or eulogy here. It is <i>the</i> standard work on its
subject,&mdash;'these rowsey, ragged, rabblement of rakehelles' (p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>)&mdash;and
has been largely plundered by divers literary cadgers. No copy
of the first edition seems to be known to bibliographers. It was
published in 1566 or 1567,&mdash;probably the latter year,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;and must (I
conclude) have contained less than the second, as in that's 'Harman
to the Reader,' p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, below, he says 'well good reader, I meane not
to be tedyous vnto the, but haue added fyue or sixe more tales,
because some of them weare doune whyle my booke was fyrste in
the presse.' He speaks again of his first edition at p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>, below, 'I
had the best geldinge stolen oute of my pasture, that I had amongst
others, whyle this boke was <i>first a printynge</i>;' and also at p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>,
below, 'Apon Alhollenday in the morning last anno domini 1566, or
my booke was halfe printed, I meane <i>the first impression</i>.' All
Hallows' or All Saints' Day is November 1.</p>

<p>The edition called the second<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, also bearing date in 1567, is known
to us in two states, the latter of which I have called the third edition.
The first state of the second edition is shown by the Bodleian copy,
which is 'Augmented and inlarged by the fyrst author here of,' and
has, besides smaller differences specified in the footnotes in our
pages, this great difference, that the arrangement of 'The Names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span><span class="sidenote">HARMAN'S <i>CAUEAT</i>: THE TWO STATES OF THE 2ND EDITION.</span>the Vpright Men, Roges, and Pallyards' is not alphabetical, by the
first letter of the Christian names, as in the second state of the second
edition (which I call the third edition), but higgledy-piggledy, or, at
least, without attention to the succession of initials either of Christian
or Sur-names, thus, though in three columns:</p>

<p class="center">[&amp;c.]</p>

<p>This alone settles the priority of the Bodley edition, as no printer,
having an index alphabetical, would go and muddle it all again, even
for a lark. Moreover, the other collations confirm this priority. The
colophon of the Bodley edition is dated <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1567, 'the eight of
January;' and therefore <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1567-8.</p>

<p>The second state of the second edition&mdash;which state I call the
third edition&mdash;is shown by the copy which Mr Henry Huth has,
with his never-failing generosity, lent us to copy and print from. It
omits 'the eight of January,' from the colophon, and has 'Anno
Domini 1567' only. Like the 2nd edition (or 2 A), this 3rd edition
(or 2 B) has the statement on p. <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, below: 'Whyle this second Impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>was in printinge, it fortuned that Nycholas Blunte, who
called hym selfe Nycholan Gennyns, a counterefet Cranke, that is
spoken of in this booke, was fonde begging in the whyte fryers on
Newe yeares day last past. Anno domini .1567, and commytted vnto
a offescer, who caried hym vnto the depetye of the ward, which co<i>m</i>mytted
hym vnto the counter;' and this brings both the 2nd and 3rd
editions (or 2 A and 2 B) to the year 1568, modern style. The 4th
edition, so far as I know, was published in 1573, and was reprinted
by Machell Stace (says Bohn's Lowndes) in 1814. From that reprint
Mr W. M. Wood has made a collation of words, not letters, for us
with the 3rd edition. The chief difference of the 4th edition is its extension
of the story of the 'dyssembling Cranke,' Nycholas Genings,
and 'the Printar of this booke' Wylliam Gryffith (p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>-<a href="#Page_56">6</a>, below),
which extension is given in the footnotes to pages <a href="#Page_56">56</a> and <a href="#Page_57">57</a> of our
edition. We were obliged to reprint this from Stace's reprint of 1814,
as our searchers could not find a copy of the 4th edition of 1573 in
either the British Museum, the Bodleian, or the Cambridge
University Library.</p>

<p>Thus much about our present edition. I now hark back to the
first, and the piracies of it or the later editions, mentioned in Mr J.
P. Collier's <i>Registers of the Stationers' Company</i>, i. 155-6, 166.</p>

<div class="blockquotn">

<p>"[No edition of Harman's 'Caveat or Warning for common Cursetors,'
of the date of 1566, is known, although it is erroneously mentioned in
the introductory matter to the reprint in 1814, from H. Middleton's impression
of 1573. It was the forerunner of various later works of the
same kind, some of which were plundered from it without acknowledgment,
and attributed to the celebrated Robert Greene. Copies of two
editions in 1567, by Griffith, are extant, and, in all probability, it was
the first time it appeared in print: Griffith entered it at Stationers' Hall,
as above, in 1566, in order that he might publish it in 1567. Harman's
work was preceded by several ballads relating to vagabonds, the earliest
of which is entered on p. 42 [Awdeley, p. ii. above]. On a subsequent
page (166) is inserted a curious entry regarding 'the boke of Rogges,'
or Rogues.]</p></div>

<p>"[This was certainly Harman's 'Caveat or Warning for Common
Cursetors'; and here we see Bynneman fined for endeavouring to <i>undermine</i>
Griffith by procuring the copy of the work, in order that Bynneman
might print and publish it instead of Griffith, his rival in business.
The next item may show that Gerard Dewes had also printed the book,
no doubt without license, but the memorandum was crossed out in the
register.]</p></div>

<p>"[All tends to prove the desire of stationers to obtain some share of
the profits of a work, which, as we have already shown, was so well received,
that Griffith published two editions of it in 1567.]"</p></div>

<p>The fact is, the book was so interesting that it made its readers
thieves, as 'Jack Sheppard' has done in later days. The very wood-cutter
cheated Harman of the hind legs of the horse on his title,
prigged two of his prauncer's props (p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>).</p>

<p>To know the keen inquiring Social Reformer, Thomas Harman, the
reader must go to his book. He lived in the country (p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, foot),
in [Crayford] Kent (p. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>, p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>), near a heath (p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>), near Lady
Elizabeth Shrewsbury's parish (p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>), not far from London (p. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>); 'he lodged at the White Friars within the cloister' (p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>),
seemingly while he was having his book printed (p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>), and had his
servant there with him (<i>ib.</i>); 'he knew London well' (p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, &amp;c.);
and in Kent 'beinge placed as a poore gentleman,' he had in 1567,
'kepte a house these twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty dayely
hath and doth repayre,' and where, being kept at home 'through
sickenes, he talked dayly with many of these wyly wanderars, as well
men and wemmen, as boyes and gyrles,' whose tricks he has so
pleasantly set down for us. He did not, though, confine his intercourse
with vagabonds to talking, for he says of some, p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATUS AND CHARACTER OF THOMAS HARMAN.</div>
<p>Our author also practically exposed these tricks, as witness his
hunting out the Cranke, Nycholas Genings, and his securing the
vagabond's 13<i>s.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> for the poor of Newington parish, p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>-<a href="#Page_56">6</a>,
his making the deaf and dumb beggar hear and speak, p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>-<a href="#Page_59">9</a> (and

yet he could write verses&mdash;though awfully bad ones: see them at

he says, and judged malefactors, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, though he evidently was not a

which the Pryggers of Prauncers prigged (p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>); he had an unchaste
cow that went to bull every month (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>, if his ownership is
not chaff here); he had in his 'well-house on the backe side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>his house, a great cawdron of copper' which the beggars stole (p.
<a href="#Page_34">34</a>-<a href="#Page_35">5</a>); he couldn't keep his linen on his hedges or in his rooms,
or his pigs and poultry from the thieves (p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>); he hated the
'rascal rabblement' of them (p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>), and 'the wicked parsons
that keepe typlinge Houses in all shires, where they haue succour
and reliefe'; and, like a wise and practical man, he set himself to
find out and expose all their 'vndecent, dolefull [guileful] dealing,
and execrable exercyses' (p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>) to the end that they might be
stopt, and sin and wickedness might not so much abound, and
thus 'this Famous Empyre be in more welth, and better florysh, to
the inestymable joye and comfort' of his great Queen, Elizabeth, and
the 'vnspeakable ... reliefe and quietnes of minde, of all her faythfull
Commons and Subiectes.' The right end, and the right way to
it. We've some like you still, Thomas Harman, in our Victorian
time. May their number grow!</p>

<p>Thus much about Harman we learn from his book and his
literary contemporaries and successors. If we now turn to the historian
of his county, Hasted, we find further interesting details
about our author: 1, that he lived in Crayford parish, next to
Erith, the Countess of Shrewsbury's parish; 2, that he inherited
the estates of Ellam, and Maystreet, and the manor of Mayton or
Maxton; 3, that he was the grandson of Henry Harman, Clerk of
the Crown, who had for his arms 'Argent, a chevron between 3
scalps sable,' which were no doubt those stampt on our Thomas's
pewter dishes; 4, that he had a 'descendant,'&mdash;a son, I presume&mdash;who
inherited his lands, and three daughters, one of whom, Bridget,
married Henry Binneman&mdash;? not the printer, about 1565-85 <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>, p.

<div class="sidenote">HARRISON ON ENGLISH VAGABONDS IN 1577-86 A.D.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>The excellent parson, William Harrison, in his 'Description of
England,' prefixed to Holinshed's Chronicles (edit. 1586), quotes
Harman fairly enough in his chapter "Of prouision made for the
poore," Book II, chap. 10.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And as he gives a statement of the
sharp punishment enacted for idle rogues and vagabonds by the
Statutes of Elizabeth, I take a long extract from his said chapter.
After speaking of those who are made 'beggers through other mens
occasion,' and denouncing the grasping landlords 'who make them
so, and wipe manie out of their occupiengs,' Harrison goes on to
those who are beggars 'through their owne default' (p. 183, last line
of col. 1, ed. 1586):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Such as are idle beggers through their owne default are of two
sorts, and continue their estates either by casuall or meere voluntarie
meanes: those that are such by casuall means <a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>are in the beginning<a name="FNanchor_16a_16a" id="FNanchor_16a_16a"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>

they can to continue their miserie; and, with such impediments as they
haue, to straie and wander about, as creatures abhorring all labour and
euerie honest excercise. Certes, I call these casuall meanes, not in respect
of the originall of their pouertie, but of the continuance of the
same, from whence they will not be deliuered, such<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is their owne
vngratious lewdnesse and froward disposition. The voluntarie meanes
proceed from outward causes, as by making of corosiues, and applieng
the same to the more fleshie parts of their bodies; and also laieng of
ratsbane, sperewort, crowfoot, and such like vnto their whole members,
thereby to raise pitifull<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and odious sores, and mooue <a name="FNanchor_16d_16d" id="FNanchor_16d_16d"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>the harts of<a name="FNanchor_16e_16e" id="FNanchor_16e_16e"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the

beg, what forcible speech, and how they select and choose out words of
vehemencie, whereby they doo in maner coniure or adiure the goer by
to pitie their cases, I passe ouer to remember, as iudging the name of
God and Christ to be more conuersant in the mouths of none, and yet

<p>Among the users of Harman's book, the chief and coolest was the
author of <i>The groundworke of Conny-catching</i>, 1592, who wrote a
few introductory pages, and then quietly reprinted almost all Harman's
book with an 'I leaue you now vnto those which by Maister
Harman are discouered' (p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>, below). By this time Harman was
no doubt dead.&mdash;Who will search for his Will in the Wills Office?&mdash;Though
Samuel Rowlands was alive, he did not show up this early
appropriator of Harman's work as he did a later one. As a kind of
Supplement to the <i>Caueat</i>, I have added, as the 4th tract in the
present volume, such parts of the <i>Groundworke of Conny-catching</i> as
are not reprinted from Harman. The <i>Groundworke</i> has been attributed
to Robert Greene, but on no evidence (I believe) except
Greene's having written a book in three Parts on Conny-catching,
1591-2, and 'A Disputation betweene a Hee Conny-catcher and a
Shee Conny-catcher, whether a Theafe or a Whore is most hvrtfull
in Cousonage to the Common-wealth,' 1592.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Hearne's copy of the
<i>Groundworke</i> is bound up in the 2nd vol. of Greene's Works, among
George III.'s books in the British Museum, as if it really was
Greene's.</p>

<p>Another pilferer from Harman was Thomas Dekker, in his <i>Belman
of London</i>, 1608, of which three editions were published in the
same year (<i>Hazlitt</i>). But Samuel Rowlands found him out and
showed him up. From the fifth edition of the Belman, the earliest
that our copier, Mr W. M. Wood, could find in the British Museum,
he has drawn up the following account of the book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>The Belman of London. Bringing to Light the most notorious Villanies

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>On the back of the title-page, after the table of contents, the
eleven following 'secret villanies' are described, severally, as</p>

<p class="center">Five Iumpes at Leape-frog."</p>

<p>After a short description of the four ages of the world, there is an
account of a feast, at which were present all kinds of vagabonds.
Dekker was conveyed, by 'an old nimble-tong'd beldam, who seemed
to haue the command of the place,' to an upper loft, 'where, vnseene,
I might, through a wooden Latice that had prospect of the dining
roome, both see and heare all that was to be done or spoken.'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The whole assembly being thus gathered together, one, amongest
the rest, who tooke vpon him a Seniority ouer the rest, charged euery
man to answer to his name, to see if the Iury were full:&mdash;the Bill by
which hee meant to call them beeing a double Iug of ale (that had the
spirit of <i>Aquavitæ</i> in it, it smelt so strong), and that hee held in his hand.
Another, standing by, with a toast, nutmeg, and ginger, ready to cry <i>Vous
avez</i> as they were cald, and all that were in the roome hauing single pots
by the eares, which, like Pistols, were charged to goe off so soone as euer
they heard their names. This Ceremony beeing set abroach, an Oyes was
made. But he that was Rector Chory (the Captain of the Tatterdemalions)
spying one to march vnder his Colours, that had neuer before serued in
those lowsie warres, paused awhile (after hee had taken his first draught,
to tast the dexterity of the liquor), and then began, Iustice-like, to
examine this yonger brother vpon interrogatories.'</p></div>

<p>This yonger brother is afterwards 'stalled to the rogue;' and the
'Rector Chory<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>' instructs him in his duties, and tells him the names
and degrees of the fraternity of vagabonds. Then comes the feast,
after which, 'one who tooke vpon him to be speaker to the whole
house,' began, as was the custom of their meeting, 'to make an
oration in praise of Beggery, and of those that professe the trade,'
which done, all the company departed, leaving the 'old beldam' and
Dekker the only occupants of the room.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The spirit of her owne mault walkt in her brain-pan, so that, what

and the rest were, with their seuerall qualities and manners of life,
Thus shee began.'</p></div>

<p>And what she tells Dekker is taken, all of it, from Harman's
book.</p>

<p>Afterwards come accounts of the five 'Laws' and five jumps at
leap-frog mentioned on the back of the title-page, and which is
quoted above, p. <a href="#Page_xv">xv</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly 'A short Discourse of Canting,' which is, entirely, taken
from Harman, pages <a href="#Page_84">84</a>-<a href="#Page_87">87</a>, below.</p>

<p>As I have said before, Dekker was shown up for his pilferings
from Harman by Samuel Rowlands, who must, says Mr Collier in his
Bibliographical Catalogue, have published his <i>Martin Mark-all,
Beadle of Bridewell</i>, in or before 1609,&mdash;though no edition is known
to us before 1610,&mdash;because Dekker in an address 'To my owne
Nation' in his <i>Lanthorne and Candle-light</i>, which was published in
1609, refers to Rowlands as a 'Beadle of Bridewell.' 'You shall
know him,' (says Dekker, speaking of a rival author, [that is, Samuel
Rowlands] whom he calls 'a Usurper') 'by his Habiliments, for (by
the furniture he weares) hee will bee taken for a <i>Beadle of Bridewell</i>.'
That this 'Usurper' was Rowlands, we know by the latter's
saying in <i>Martin Mark-all</i>, leaf E, i back, 'although he (the Bel-man,
that is, Dekker) is bold to call me an <i>usurper</i>; for so he doth in his
last round.'</p>

<p>Well, from this treatise of Rowlands', Mr Wood has made the
following extracts relating to Dekker and Harman, together with
Rowlands's own list of slang words not in Dekker or Harman, and
'the errour in his [Dekker's] words, and true englishing of the
same:'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Martin Mark-all, his Apologie to the Bel-man of London. There
hath been of late dayes great paines taken on the part of the good old
Bel-man of London, in discouering, as hee thinks, a new-found Nation
and People. Let it be so for this time: hereupon much adoe was made
in setting forth their lines, order of lining, method of speech, and vsuall
meetings, with diuers other things thereunto appertaining. These
volumes and papers, now spread euerie where, so that euerie Iacke-boy
now can say as well as the proudest of that fraternitie, "will you wapp for
a wyn, or tranie for a make?" The gentle Company of Cursitours began
now to stirre, and looke about them; and hauing gathered together a
Conuocation of Canting Caterpillars, as wel in the North parts at the
Diuels arse apeake,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> as in the South, they diligently enquired, and
straight search was made, whether any had reuolted from that faithles
fellowship. Herupon euery one gaue his verdict: some supposed that
it might be some one that, hauing ventured to farre beyond wit and
good taking heede, was fallen into the hands of the Magistrate, and
carried to the trayning Cheates, where, in shew of a penitent heart, and
remoarse of his good time ill spent, turned the cocke, and let out all:
others thought it might be some spic-knaue that, hauing little to doe,
tooke vpon him the habite and forme of an Hermite; and so, by dayly
commercing and discoursing, learned in time the mysterie and knowlege
of this ignoble profession: and others, because it smelt of a study,
deemed it to be some of their owne companie, that had been at some
free-schoole, and belike, because hee would be handsome against a good
time, tooke pen and inke, and wrote of that subiect; thus, <i>Tot homines,
tot sententiæ</i>, so many men, so many mindes. And all because the spightfull
Poet would not set too his name. At last vp starts an old Cacodemicall
Academicke with his frize bonnet, and giues them al to know,
that this invectiue was set foorth, made, and printed Fortie yeeres agoe.
And being then called, 'A caueat for Cursitors,' is now newly printed,
and termed, 'The Bel-man of London,' made at first by one Master Harman,
a Iustice of Peace in Kent, in Queene Marie's daies,&mdash;he being then
about ten yeeres of age.' Sign. A. 2.</p>

<p>'They (the vagabonds) haue a language among themselues, composed
of <i>omnium gatherum</i>; a glimering whereof, one of late daies hath
endeuoured to manifest, as farre as his Authour is pleased to be an intelligencer.

<p>'Because the Bel-man entreateth any that is more rich in canting,
to lend him better or more with variety, he will repay his loue double,
I haue thought good, not only to shew his errour in some places in setting
downe olde wordes vsed fortie yeeres agoe, before he was borne, for
wordes that are vsed in these dayes (although he is bold to call me an
vsurper (for so he doth in his last round), and not able to maintayne the

of vaine glorie, as his ambition is, but, indeede, as an experienced souldier
that hath deerely paid for it: and therefore it shall be honour good
enough for him (if not too good) to come vp with the Reare (I doe but
shoote your owne arrow back againe), and not to haue the leading of

<p>Richard Head (says Mr Hotten), in his <i>English Rogue, described
in the Life of Meriton Latroon, a Witty Extravagant</i>, 4 vols. 12mo.,
1671-80, gave "a glossary of Cant words 'used by the Gipsies'; but
it was only a reprint of what Decker had given sixty years before,"
and therefore merely taken from Harman too. 'The Bibliography
of Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Language' has been given so fully at the
end of Mr Hotten's Slang Dictionary, that I excuse myself from
pursuing the subject farther. I only add here Mr Wood's extracts
from four of the treatises on this subject not noticed by Mr Hotten
in the 1864 edition of his Dictionary, but contained (with others) in
a most curious volume in the British Museum, labelled <i>Practice of
Robbers</i>,&mdash;Press Mark 518. h. 2.,&mdash;as also some of the slang words in
these little books not given by Harman<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>:</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARSON HABEN'S <i>SERMON ON THIEVES</i>.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>The third piece in the present volume is a larky Sermon in
praise of Thieves and Thievery, the title of which (p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>, below)
happened to catch my eye when I was turning over the Cotton
Catalogue, and which was printed here, as well from its suiting
the subject, as from a pleasant recollection of a gallop some 30
years ago in a four-horse coach across Harford-Bridge-Flat, where
Parson Haben (or Hyberdyne), who is said to have preached the
Sermon, was no doubt robbed. My respected friend Goody-goody
declares the sermon to be 'dreadfully irreverent;' but one needn't
mind him. An earlier copy than the Cotton one turned up among
the Lansdowne MSS, and as it differed a good deal from the Cotton
text, it has been printed opposite to that.</p>

<p>Of the fourth piece in this little volume, <i>The Groundworke of
Conny-catching</i>, less its reprint from Harman, I have spoken above,
at p. <a href="#Page_xiv">xiv</a>. There was no good in printing the whole of it, as we
should then have had Harman twice over.</p>

<p class="p2">The growth of the present Text was on this wise: Mr Viles
suggested a reprint of Stace's reprint of Harman in 1573, after it had
been read with the original, and collated with the earlier editions.
The first edition I could not find, but ascertained, with some trouble,
and through Mr W. C. Hazlitt, where the second and third editions
were, and borrowed the 3rd of its ever-generous owner, Mr Henry
Huth. Then Mr Hazlitt told me of Awdeley, which he thought was
borrowed from Harman. However, Harman's own words soon
settled that point; and Awdeley had to precede Harman. Then
the real bagger from Harman, the <i>Groundworke</i>, had to be added,
after the Parson's Sermon. Mr Viles read the proofs and revises
of Harman with the original: Mr Wood and I have made the Index;
and I, because Mr Viles is more desperately busy than myself, have
written the Preface.</p>

<p>The extracts from Mr J. P. Collier must be taken for what they
are worth. I have not had time to verify them; but assume them to
be correct, and not ingeniously or unreasonably altered from their
originals, like Mr Collier's print of Henslowe's Memorial, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>Dr <span class="sidenote">MR PAYNE COLLIER'S WORK AND ALTERATIONS.</span>Ingleby complains,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and like his notorious Alleyn letter. If some
one only would follow Mr Collier through all his work&mdash;pending his
hoped-for Retractations,&mdash;and assure us that the two pieces above-named,
and the Perkins Folio, are the only things we need reject,
such some-one would render a great service to all literary antiquarians,
and enable them to do justice to the wonderful diligence,
knowledge, and acumen, of the veteran pioneer in their path. Certainly,
in most of the small finds which we workers at this Text
thought we had made, we afterwards found we had been anticipated
by Mr Collier's <i>Registers of the Stationers' Company</i>, or <i>Bibliographical
Catalogue</i>, and that the facts were there rightly stated.
<span class="sidenote">PRINT THE STATIONERS' REGISTERS.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>That there is pure metal in Mr Collier's work, and a good deal
of it, few will doubt; but the dross needs refining out. I hope
that the first step in the process may be the printing of the whole
of the Stationers' Registers from their start to 1700 at least, by the
Camden Society,&mdash;within whose range this work well lies,&mdash;or by
the new Harleian or some other Society. It ought not to be left
to the 'Early English Text' to do some 20 years hence.</p>

<p>The print of the Stationers' Registers calld for above, has since been

S. Rowland's <i>Martin Mark-all</i> (p. <a href="#Page_xvi">xvi</a>, above) from the text of 1610, in its
handsome edition of all Rowlands's works.</p>

<p>As connected, more or less, with the Vagabonds of London, I add, opposite,
a copy of the curious cut of the notorious Southwark brothel, 'Holland's
Leaguer' in 1632, on which Mr. Rendle has commented in his "Bankside,
Southwark," <i>Harrison</i>, Part II. p. ix-x, and the site of which is shown on
the left of our first plan from Roque's Map, <i>ib.</i> p. 67*.</p>

<p>The Brothel is shown, says Mr. Ebsworth, (<i>Amanda Ballads</i>, 1880, p. 507*),
fortified and sentried, as kept by a Mrs. Holland, before 1631. "The picture
was frontispiece of a quarto pamphlet, '<i>Holland's Leaguer; or, an Historical
Discourse of the Life and Actions of Donna Britanica Hollandia, the Arch
Mistris of the wicked women of Eutopia: wherein is detected the notorious sinne
of Pandarisme</i>,' etc., sm. 4to. printed by A. M. for Richard Barnes, 1632....</p>

<p>"Holland's Leaguer claimed to be an island out of the ordinary jurisdiction.
The portcullis, drawbridge, moat, and wicket for espial, as well as an armed
bully or Pandar to quell disagreeable intruders, if by chance they got
admittance without responsible introduction, all point to an organized system.
There were also the garden-walks for sauntering and 'doing a spell of
embroidery, or fine work,' <i>i.e.</i> flirtation; the summer-house that was proverbially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>famous <span class="sidenote">FORETALK TO REPRINT OF 1880.</span>or infamous for intrigues, and the river conveniently near for
disposal of awkward visitors who might have met with misadventure.</p>

<p>"Shackerly Marmion's 'excellent comedy,' <i>Holland's Leaguer</i>, 1632, was
reprinted in 1875, in William Paterson of Edinburgh's choice series, <i>Dramatists
of the Restoration</i>. The fourth act gives an exposure of the Leaguers' garrison,
where riot, disease, and robbery are unchecked. Thus <i>Trimalchio</i> says,</p>

Mr E. W. Ashbee has, at my request, and by permission of the Governors
of Dulwich College (where the paper is preserved), furnished me with an exact
fac-simile of it, worked off on somewhat similar paper. By means of this fac-simile
my readers may readily assure themselves that in no part of the memorial
is Lodge called a "player;" indeed he is not called "Thos. Lodge,"
and it is only an inference, an unavoidable conclusion, that the Lodge here
spoken of is Thomas Lodge, the dramatist. Mr Collier, however, professes to
find that he is there called "Thos. Lodge," and that it [the Memorial] contains
this remarkable grammatical inversion;
</p><div class="blockquot"><p>
"and haveinge some knowledge and acquaintaunce of him as a player,
requested me to be his baile,"</p></div>
<p class="noi">
which is evidently intended to mean, <i>as I had some knowledge and acquaintance
of Lodge as a player, he requested me to be his baile</i>. But in this place
the original paper reads thus,
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"and havinge of me some knowledge and acquaintaunce requested me
to be his bayle,"</p></div>
<p class="noi">
meaning, of course, <i>Lodge, having some knowledge and acquaintance of me
requested me to be his bail</i>.
</p><p>
The interpolation of the five words needed to corroborate Mr Collier's
explanation of the misquoted passage from Gosson, and the omission of two
other words inconsistent with that interpolation, may be thought to exhibit
some little ingenuity; it was, however, a feat which could have cost him no
great pains. But the labour of recasting the orthography of the memorial
must have been considerable; while it is difficult to imagine a rational motive
to account for such labour being incurred. To expand the abbreviations and
modernize the orthography might have been expedient, as it would have been
easy. But, in the name of reason, what is the gain of writing <i>wheare</i> and
<i>theare</i> for "where" and "there;" <i>cleere</i>, <i>yeeld</i>, and <i>meerly</i> for "clere,"
"yealde," and "merely;" <i>verie</i>, <i>anie</i>, <i>laie</i>, <i>waie</i>, <i>paie</i>, <i>yssue</i>, and <i>pryvily</i>, for
"very," "any," "lay," "way," "pay," "issue," and "privylie;" <i>sondrie</i>, <i>begon</i>,
and <i>doen</i> for "sundrie," "began," and "don;" and <i>thintent</i>, <i>thaction</i>, and
<i>thacceptaunce</i> for "the intent," "the action," and "the acceptaunce"?&mdash;p. 14

<h5>¶ A CURTESY MAN.</h5>

<p>A Curtesy man is one that walketh about the back lanes in
London in the day time, and sometime in the broade streetes in the
night season, and when he meeteth some handsome yong man clenly
apareled, or some other honest Citizen, he maketh humble salutatio<i>n</i>s
and low curtesy, and sheweth him that he hath a worde or two
to speake with his mastership. This child can behaue him selfe
manerly, for he wyll desire him that he talketh withall, to take the
vpper hand, and shew him much reuerence, and at last like his
familier acquaintaunce will put on his cap, and walke syde by syde,
and talke on this fashion: Oh syr, you seeme to be a man, and one
that fauoureth men, and therefore I am the more bolder to breake
my mind vnto your good maistership. Thus it is syr, ther is a certaine
of vs (though I say it both taule and handsome men of theyr
hands) which haue come lately from the wars, and as God knoweth
haue nothing to take to, being both maisterles and moniles, &amp; knowing
no way wherby to yerne one peny. And further, wher as we
haue bene welthely brought vp, and we also haue beene had in good
estimatio<i>n</i>, we are a shamed now to declare our misery, and to fall
a crauing as common Beggers, and as for to steale and robbe, (God is
our record) it striketh vs to <span class="small">[leaf 4]</span> the hart, to thinke of such a
mischiefe, that euer any handsome man should fall into such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>daunger for thys worldly trash. Which if we had to suffise our
want and necessity, we should neuer seeke thus shamefastly to craue
on such good pityfull men as you seeme to be, neither yet so daungerously
to hasarde our liues for so vyle a thing. Therefore good syr,
as you seeme to be a handsome man your selfe, and also such a one
as pitieth the miserable case of handsome men, as now your eyes
and countenaunce sheweth to haue some pity vppon this my miserable
complainte: So in Gods cause I require your maistershyp, &amp; in
the behalfe of my poore afflicted fellowes, which though here in sight
they cry not with me to you, yet wheresouer they bee, I am sure
they cry vnto God to moue the heartes of some good men to shew
forth their liberality in this behalfe. All which &amp; I with them craue
now the same request at your good masterships hand. With these or
such like words he frameth his talke. Now if the party (which he
thus talketh withall) profereth hym a peny or .ii.d. he taketh it, but
verye scornfully, and at last speaketh on this sorte: Well syr, your
good will is not to be refused. But yet you shall vnderstand (good
syr) that this is nothing for them, for whom I do thus shamefastly
entreate. Alas syr, it is not a groate or .xii.d. I speake for, being
such a company of Seruiters as wee haue bene: yet neuertheles God
forbid I should not receiue your ge<i>n</i>tle offer at this time, hoping
hereafter through your good motions to some such lyke good gentleman
as you be, that I, or some of my fellowes in my place, shall
finde the more liberality. These kind of ydle Vacabondes wyll go
commonly well appareled, without <span class="small">[leaf 4b.]</span> any weapon, and in
place where they meete together, as at their hosteryes or other places,
they wyll beare the port of ryght good gentlemen, &amp; some are the
more trusted, but co<i>m</i>monly thei pay them w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> stealing a paire of
sheetes, or Couerlet, &amp; so take their farewell earely in the morning,
before the mayster or dame be sturring.</p>

<h5>¶ A CHEATOUR OR FINGERER.</h5>

<p>These commonly be such kinde of idle Vacabondes as scarcely a
man shall discerne, they go so gorgeously, sometime with waiting
men, and sometime without. Their trade is to walke in such places,
where as gentelmen &amp; other worshipfull Citizens do resorte, as at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>Poules, or at Christes Hospital, &amp; somtime at ye Royal exchaunge.
These haue very many acquaintaunces, yea, and for the most part will
acquaint them selues with euery man, and fayne a society, in one
place or other. But chiefly they wil seeke their acquaintaunce of
such (which they haue learned by diligent enquiring where they resort)
as haue receyued some porcioun of money of their friends, as
yong Gentlemen which are sent to London to study the lawes, or els
some yong Marchant man or other kynde of Occupier, whose friendes
hath geuen them a stock of mony<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to occupy withall. When they
haue thus found out such a pray, they will find the meanes by theyr
familiarity, as very curteously to bid him to breakefast at one place
or other, where they are best acquainted, and closely amonge themselues
wil appoint one of their Fraternity, which they call a Fyngerer,
an olde beaten childe, not onely in such deceites, but also such
a one as by his age is painted out with gray heares, wrinkled face,
crooked back, and most commonly lame, as it might seeme with age,
<span class="small">[leaf 5]</span> yea and such a one as to shew a simplicity, shal weare a
homely cloke and hat scarce worth .vi. d. This nimble fingred
knight (being appointed to this place) co<i>m</i>meth in as one not
knowen of these Cheatours, but as vnwares shal sit down at the end
of the bord where they syt, &amp; call for his peny pot of wine, or a
pinte of Ale, as the place serueth. Thus sitting as it were alone,
mumblyng on a crust, or some such thing, these other yonckers wil
finde some kind of mery talke with him, some times questioning
wher he dwelleth, &amp; sometimes enquiring what trade he vseth, which
co<i>m</i>monly he telleth them he vseth husbandry: &amp; talking thus
merely, at last they aske him, how sayest thou, Father, wylt thou play
for thy breakfast with one of vs, that we may haue some pastime as
we syt? Thys olde Karle makyng it straunge at the first saith: My
maysters, ich am an old man, and halfe blinde, and can skyl of very
few games, yet for that you seeme to be such good Gentelmen, as to
profer to play for that of which you had no part, but onely I my
selfe, and therefore of right ich am worthy to pay for it, I shal with
al my hart fulfyl your request. And so falleth to play, somtime at
Cardes &amp; sometime at dice. Which through his cou<i>n</i>terfait simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>in the play somtimes ouer counteth himself, or playeth somtimes
against his wyl, so as he would not, &amp; then counterfaiteth to be
angry, and falleth to swearing, &amp; so leesing that, profereth to play for
a shillyng or two. The other therat hauing good sport, seming to
mocke him, falleth againe to play, and so by their legerdemane, &amp;
cou<i>n</i>terfaiting, winneth ech of them a shilling or twain, &amp; at last
whispereth the yong man in the eare to play with hym also, that
ech one might haue a fling at him. <span class="small">[leaf 5b.]</span> This yong ma<i>n</i> for
company falleth againe to play also with the sayd Fyngerer, and winneth
as the other did which when he had loste a noble or .vi. s.
maketh as though he had lost al his mony, and falleth a intreating
for parte thereof againe to bring him home, which the other knowing
his mind and intent, stoutely denieth and iesteth, &amp; scoffeth at
him. This Fingerer seeming then to be in a rage, desireth the<i>m</i> as
they are true gentlemen, to tarry till he fetcheth more store of money,
or els to point some place where they may meete. They seeming
greedy hereof, promiseth faithfully and clappeth handes so to meete.
They thus ticklyng the young man in the eare, willeth him to make
as much money as he can, and they wil make as much as they can,
and co<i>n</i>sent as though they wil play booty against him. But in the
ende they so vse the matter, that both the young man leeseth his
part, and, as it seemeth to him, they leesing theirs also, and so maketh
as though they would fal together by the eares with this fingerer,
which by one wyle or other at last conueyeth him selfe away, &amp; they
as it were raging lyke mad bedlams, one runneth one way, an other an
other way, leauing the loser indeede all alone. Thus these Cheatours
at their accustomed hosteries meete closely together, and there receiue
ech one his part of this their vile spoyle. Of this fraternity
there be that be called helpers, which commonly haunt tauernes or
alehouses, and co<i>m</i>meth in as men not acquainted with none in the
companye, but spying them at any game, wil byd them God spede
and God be at their game, and will so place him selfe that he will
shew his fellow by sygnes and tokens, without speech commonly, but
sometime with far fetched <span class="small">[leaf 6]</span> wordes, what cardes he hath in
his hand, and how he may play against him. And those betwene
the<i>m</i> both getteth money out of the others purse.</p>

<h5>¶ A RING FALLER.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></h5>

<p>A Ryng faller is he that getteth fayre copper rings, some made like
signets, &amp; some after other fashio<i>n</i>s, very faire gylded, &amp; walketh vp
and down the streetes, til he spieth some man of the country, or
some other simple body whom he thinketh he may deceaue, and so
goeth a lyttle before him or them, and letteth fall one of these
ringes, which when the party that commeth after spieth and taketh
it vp, he hauing an eye backward, crieth halfe part, the party that
taketh it vp, thinking it to be of great value, profereth him some
money for his part, which he not fully denieth, but willeth him to
come into some alehouse or tauerne, and there they will common
vpon the matter. Which when they come in, and are set in some
solitary place (as commonly they call for such a place) there he desireth
the party that found the ring to shew it him. When he seeth
it, he falleth a entreating the party that found it, and desireth him
to take money for his part, and telleth him that if euer he may do
him any frendship hereafter he shal commaund him, for he maketh
as though he were very desirous to haue it. The symple man seeing
him so importune vpon it, thinketh the ring to bee of great valure,
and so is the more lother to part from it. At last this ring faller
asketh him what he will geue him for his part, for, saith he, seeing
you wyl not let me haue the ring, alowe me my part, and take you
the ring. The other asketh what he counteth the ring to be worth,
he answereth, v. or vi. pound. No, saith he, it is not so much
worth. <span class="small">[leaf 6b.]</span> Well (saith this Ringfaller) let me haue it, and I
wyll alow you .xl. s. for your part. The other party standyng in a
doubt, and looking on the ryng, asketh if he wyll geue the money
out of hand. The other answereth, he hath not so much ready
mony about him, but he wil go fetch so much for him, if he wil go
with him. The other that found the ring, thinking he meaneth truly,
beginneth to profer him .xx. s. for his part, sometymes more, or les,
which he verye scornfullye refuseth at the first, and styl entreateth
that he might haue the ring, which maketh the other more fonder of
it, and desireth him to take the money for his part, &amp; so profereth
him money. This ring faller seing y<sup>e</sup> mony, maketh it very strau<i>n</i>ge,
and first questioneth with him wher he dwelleth, and asketh him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>what is his name, &amp; telleth him that he semeth to be an honest
man, and therfore he wil do somwhat for friendships sake, hoping to
haue as friendly a pleasure at his hand hereafter, and so profereth
hym for .x. s. more he should haue the ryng. At last, with entreatye
on both partes, he geueth the Ring faller the money, and so departeth,
thinkyng he hath gotten a very great Iewell. These kynde of
deceyuing Vacabondes haue other practises with their rings, as somtimes
to come to buy wares of mens Prentesies, and somtimes of their
Maisters, and when he hath agreed of the price, he sayth he hath not
so much money about him, but pulleth of one of these rings of from
his fyngers, and profereth to leaue it in pawne, tyl his Maister or
his friendes hath sene it, so promising to bring the money, the seller
thinking he meaneth truly, letteth him go, and neuer seeth him after,
tyll perhaps at Tyburne or at such lyke place. Ther is another kinde
of <span class="small">[leaf 7]</span> these Ring choppers, which co<i>m</i>monly cary about them a
faire gold ring in deede, and these haue other counterfait rings made
so lyke this gold ring, as ye shal not perceiue the contrary, tyl it be
brought to y<sup>e</sup> touchstone. This child wyl come to borow mony of
the right gold ring, the party mistrusting the Ring not to be good,
goeth to the Goldsmith with the partye that hath the ryng, and
tryeth it whether it be good golde, and also wayeth it to know how
much it is worth. The Goldsmith tryeth it to be good gold, and also
to haue hys ful weight like gold, and warenteth the party which shall
lend the money that the ring is worth so much money according to
the waight, this yoncker comming home with the party which shall
lend the money, and hauing the gold ring againe, putteth vp the
gold ring, and pulleth out a counterfaite ring very like the same, &amp;
so deliuereth it to the party which lendeth the money, they thinking
it to be the same which they tryed, and so deliuereth the money or
sometimes wares, and thus vily be deceiued.</p>

<div class="noi">
<p class="chapstart">AS of Auncient and longe tyme there hath bene, and is now at

for the reliefe, succour, comforte, and sustentacion of the
poore, nedy, impotent, and myserable creatures beinge and
inhabiting in all parts of the same; So is there (ryghte honorable
and myne especyall good Lady) most holsom estatutes, ordinances,
and necessary lawes, made, setforth, and publisshed, for the
extreme punishement of all vagarantes and sturdy vacabons, as passeth
throughe and by all parts of this famous yle, most idelly and
wyckedly: and I wel, by good experience, vnderstandinge and consideringe
your most tender, pytyfull, gentle, and noble nature,&mdash;not
onelye hauinge a vygelant and mercifull eye to your poore, indygente,

gyrles, by whom I haue <span class="small">[leaf 2, back]</span> gathered and vnderstande their
depe dissimulation and detestable dealynge, beinge maruelous suttle
and craftye in there kynde, for not one amongst twenty wyll discouer,
eyther declare there scelorous secretes: yet with fayre flatteringe
wordes, money, and good chere, I haue attained to the typ by such

xvi. and some twenty and vpward,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and not withoute faythfull promesse
made vnto them neuer to discouer their names or any thinge
they shewed me; for they would all saye, yf the vpright men should
vnderstand thereof, they should not be only greuouslye beaten, but
put in daunger of their lyues, by the sayd vpright men. There
was a fewe yeares since a small bréefe setforth of some zelous
man to his countrey, of whom I knowe not, that made a lytle shewe
of there names and vsage, and gaue a glymsinge lyghte, not sufficient

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>she maye safely passe aboute and through all partes of this noble

confusion of their drowsey demener and vnlawfull language, pylfring
pycking, wily wanderinge, and lykinge lechery, of all these
rablement of rascales that raunges about al <i>th</i>e costes of the same,
So <i>tha</i>t their vndecent, dolefull dealing and execrable exercyses
may apere to all as it were in a glasse, that therby the Iusticers

begyn to freat, fume, sweare, and stare at this my booke, their lyfe
being layd open and aparantly paynted out, that their confusion
and end draweth one a pase. Where as in dede, if it be well
waied, it is set forth for their synguler profyt and co<i>m</i>moditie, for the
sure safegard of their lyues here in this world, that they shorten
not the same before<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> their time, and that by their true labour and
good lyfe, in the world to com they may saue their Soules, that
Christ, the second person in [the] Trinytie, hath so derely bought wit<i>h</i>
his most precious bloud: so that hereby I shall do them more good
then they could haue deuised for them selues. For behold, their
lyfe being so manyfest wycked and so aparantlye knowen, The honorable
wyl abhore them, The worshipfull wyll reiecte them, The
yemen wyll sharpely tawnte them, The Husband men vtterly defye
them, The laboryng men bluntly chyde them, The wemen with a loud
exclamation<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> wonder at them, And all Children with clappinge
handes crye out at them. I manye times musing with my selfe at
these mischeuous misliuers, merueled when they toke their oryginall
<i>and</i> beginning; how long they haue exercised their execrable wandring
about. I thought it méete to confer with a very old man that
I was well acquaynted with, whose wyt <i>and</i> memory is meruelous for
his yeares, beinge about the age of fourescore, what he knewe when he
was yonge of these lousey leuterars. And he shewed me, that when
he was yonge he wayted vpon a man of much worshyp in Kent, who
died immediatly after the last Duke of Buckingham was beheaded:
at his buryall there was such a number of beggers, besides poore
housholders dwelling there abouts, that vnneth they mighte lye or
stande aboute the House: then was there <span class="small">[leaf 3, back]</span> prepared for
them a great and a large barne, and a great fat oxe sod out in
Furmenty for them, with bread <i>and</i> drinke aboundantly to furnesh
out the premisses; and euery person had two pence, for such was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>dole. When Night approched, <i>th</i>e pore housholders repaired home
to their houses: the other wayfaring bold beggers remained alnight
in <i>th</i>e barne; and the same barne being serched with light in the
night by this old man (and then yonge), with<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> others, they tolde
seuen score persons of men, euery of them hauing his woma<i>n</i>, except
it were two wemen that lay alone to gether for some especyall cause.
Thus hauing their makes to make mery withall, the buriall was turned
to bousing <i>and</i> belly chere, morning to myrth, fasting to feasting,
prayer to pastyme <i>and</i> pressing of papes, and lamenting to Lechery.
So that it may apere this vncomly company hath had a long continuance,
but then nothinge geuen so much to pylferinge, pyckinge, and
spoyling; and, as far as I can learne or vnderstand by the examination
of a number of them, their languag&mdash;which they terme peddelars
Frenche or Canting&mdash;began but within these xxx. yeeres,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> lytle
aboue; and that the first inuenter therof was hanged, all saue the
head; for that is the fynall end of them all, or els to dye of some
filthy and horyble diseases: but much harme is don in the meane
space by their continuance, as some x., xii., and xvi. yeares before
they be consumed, and the number of them doth dayly renew. I
hope their synne is now at the hyghest; and that as short and as
spedy a redresse wylbe for these, as hath bene of late yeres for <i>th</i>e
wretched, wily, wandering vagabonds calling and naming them selues
Egiptians, depely dissembling and long hyding <i>and</i> couering their
depe, decetfull practises,&mdash;feding the rude common people, wholy
addicted and geuen to nouelties, toyes, and new inuentions,&mdash;delyting
them with the strangenes of the attyre of their heades, and
practising paulmistrie to such as would know their fortunes: And, to
be short, all theues and hores (as I may well wryt),&mdash;as some haue
had true experience, a number can well wytnes, and a great sorte hath
well felte it. And now (thankes bée to god), throughe wholsome
lawes, and the due execution thereof, all be dispersed, banished,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <i>and</i>
the memory of them cleane extynguished; that when they bée once
named here after, our Chyldren wyll muche meruell what kynd of
people they were: and so, I trust, shal shortly happen of these.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>For what thinge doth chiefely cause these rowsey rakehelles thus to
continue and dayly increase? Surely a number of wicked parsons
that kéepe typlinge Houses in all shires, where they haue succour
and reliefe; and what so euer they bring, they are sure to receaue
money for <span class="small">[leaf 4]</span> the same, for they sell good penyworthes. The
byers haue <i>th</i>e greatest gayne; yea, yf they haue nether money nor
ware, they wylbe trusted; their credite is much. I haue taken a
note of a good many of them, <i>and</i> wil send their names and dwelling-places
to such Iusticers as dwelleth nere or next vnto them, that
they by their good wisdomes may displace the same, and auctoryse
such as haue honesty. I wyl not blot my boke with their names,
because they be resident. But as for this fletinge Fellowshyp, I
haue truly setforth the most part of them that be doers at this present,
with their names that they be knowene by. Also, I haue
placed in the end therof their leud language, calling the same pedlers
French or Canting. And now shal I end my prologue, makinge true
declaration (right honorable Lady) as they shal fall in order of their
vntymelye tryfelinge time, leud lyfe, and pernitious practises, trusting
that the same shall neyther trouble or abash your most tender,
tymerous, and pytifull Nature, to thinke the smal mede should growe
vnto you for such Almes so geuen. For god, our marcifull and most
louing father, well knoweth your hartes and good intent,&mdash;the geuer
neuer wanteth his reward, according to the sayinge of Saynt Augustyn:
as there is (neyther shalbe) any synne vnpunished, euen so
shall there not be eny good dede vnrewarded. But how comfortably
speaketh Christ our Sauiour vnto vs in his gospel ("geue ye, and it
shalbe geuen you againe"): behold farther, good Madam, that for a
cup of colde water, Christ hath promised a good reward. Now saynt
Austen properly declareth why Christ speaketh of colde water, because
the poorest man that is shall not excuse him selfe from that
cherytable warke, least he would, parauenture, saye that he hath
neyther wood, pot, nor pan to warme any water with. Se, farther,
what god speaketh in the mouth of his prophet, Esaye, "breake thy
bread to him that is a hongred;" he sayth not geue him a hole lofe,
for paraduenture the poore man hath it not to geue, then let him geue
a pece. This much is sayd because the poore that hath it should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
be excused: now how much more then the riche? Thus you se, good</p>
<p class="narrowb">madam, for your treasure here dispersed, where nede and lacke<br />
is, it shalbe heaped vp aboundantly for you in heauen,<br />
where neither rust or moth shall corupt or destroy<br />
the same. Vnto which tryumphant place, after<br />
many good, happy, and fortunat yeres prosperouslye<br />

<p class="chapstart">AL though, good Reader, I wright in plain termes&mdash;and not so
playnly as truely&mdash;concerning the matter, meaning honestly
to all men, and wyshe them as much good as to myne owne
harte; yet, as there hathe bene, so there is nowe, and hereafter wylbe,
curyous heds to finde fauttes: wherefore I thought it necessary, now
at this seconde Impression, to acquaynt <i>th</i>e with a great faulte, as
some takethe it, but none<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> as I meane it, callinge these Vagabonds
Cursetors in the intytelynge of my booke, as runneres or rangers
aboute the countrey, deriued of this Laten word (<i>Curro</i>): neither do
I wryght it Cooresetores, with a duble<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> oo; or Cowresetors, with a w,
which hath an other singnification: is there no deuersite betwen a
gardein and a garden, maynteynaunce <i>and</i> maintenance, Streytes and
stretes? those that haue vnderstanding knowe there is a great dyfference:
who is so ignorant by these dayes as knoweth not the meaning
of a vagabone? and yf an ydell leuterar should be so called of eny
man, would not he thi<i>n</i>k it bothe odyous and reprochefull? wyll he
not shonne the name? ye, and where as he maye and dare, w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> bent
browes, wyll reueng that name of Ingnomy: yet this playne name
vagabone is deryued, as others be, of Laten wordes, and now vse
makes it commen to al men; but let vs loke back four .C. yeres
sithens, <i>and</i> let vs se whether this playn word vagabon was vsed or
no. I beleue not, and why? because I rede of no such name in the
old estatutes of this realme, vnles it be in the margente of the booke,
or in the Table, which in the collection and pryntinge was set in;
but these were then the co<i>m</i>men names of these leud leuterars,
Faytores, Robardesmen, Drawlatches, <i>and</i> valyant beggares. Yf I
should haue vsed suche wordes, or the same order of wryting, as this
realme vsed in Kynge Henry the thyrd or Edward <i>th</i>e fyrstes tyme,
oh, what a grose, barberous fellow <span class="small">[leaf 5, back]</span> haue we here! his
wryting is both homely and darke, that wee had nede to haue an

the muses; I neuer tasted of Helycon. But accordinge to my playne
order, I haue setforth this worke, symplye and truelye, with such
vsual words and termes as is among vs wel known and frequented.
So that as <i>th</i>e prouerbe saythe, "all though truth be blamed, it shal
neuer be shamed." well, good reader, I meane not to be tedyous vnto
the, but haue added fyue or sixe more tales, because some of them
weare donn whyle my booke was fyrste in the presse; and as I
truste I haue deserued no rebuke for my good wyll, euen so I desyre
no prayse for my payne, cost, and trauell. But faithfullye for the
proffyt and benyfyt of my countrey I haue don it, that the whole
body of the Realme may se and vnderstand their leud lyfe and pernitious

<p class="chapstart">THE Rufflar, because he is first in degre of this odious order:
And is so called in a statute made for the punishment of
Vacabonds, In the xxvij. yeare of Kyng Henry the eight, late
of most famous memory: Hée shall be first placed, as the
worthiest of this vnruly rablement. And he is so called when
he goeth first abroad; eyther he hath serued in the warres, or
els he hath bene a seruinge man; and, weary of well doing, shakinge
of all payne, doth chuse him this ydle lyfe, and wretchedly wanders
aboute the most shyres of this realme. And with stout audacyte,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
demaundeth where he thinketh hée maye be bolde, and circomspecte
ynough, as he sethe cause to aske charitie, rufully and lamentably,
that it would make a flyntey hart to relent, and pytie his miserable
estate, howe he hath bene maymed and broused in the warres; <i>and</i>,
parauenture, some wyll shew you some outward wounde, whiche he
gotte at some dronken fraye, eyther haltinge of some preuye wounde
festred with a fylthy firy flankard. For be well assured that the
hardist souldiers be eyther slayne or maymed, eyther and<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> they

they wyll as desperatlye fight for to lyue and mayntayne them
selues, as manfully and valyantly they ventred them selues in
the Prynces quarell. Now these Rufflars, the out castes of seruing
men, when begginge or crauinge fayles, then they pycke and pylfer,
from other inferiour beggeres that they méete by the waye, as
Roages, Pallyardes, Mortes, and Doxes. Yea, if they méete with a
woman alone ridinge to the market, eyther olde man or boye, that
hée well knoweth wyll not resiste, such they filche and spoyle.
These rufflars, after a yeare or two at the farthest, become vpryght

I had of late yeares an old man to my tennant, who customably<br />
a greate tyme went twise in the wéeke to London, eyther
wyth fruite or with pescodes, when tyme serued therefore. And as
he was comminge homewarde on blacke heathe, at the end thereof
next to shotars hyl, he ouer tooke two rufflars, the one manerly wayting
on the other, as one had ben the maister, <i>and</i> the other the man
or seruant, <span class="small">[leaf 6, back]</span> caryinge his maisteres cloke. this olde man was
verye glad that hee might haue their company ouer the hyl, because
that day he had made a good market; for hée had seuen shyllinges
in his purse, and a nolde angell, which this poore man had
thought had not bene in his purse, for hée wylled his wyfe ouer
night to take out the same angell, and laye it vp vntyll his comminge
home agayne. And he verely thought that his wyfe had so don,
whiche in dede for got to do it. Thus after salutations had, this
maister rufflar entered into co<i>m</i>munication with this simple olde
man, who, ridinge softlye beside them, commoned of many matters.
Thus fedinge this old man with pleasaunt talke, vntyll they weare
one the toppe of the hyll, where these rufflares might well beholde
the coaste about them cleare, Quiclye stepes vnto this poore man,
and taketh holde of his horse brydell, and leadeth him in to the
wode, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he had
in his purse. "Now, by my troth," quoth this old man; "you are
a merrye gentle man. I knowe you meane not to take a waye anye
thinge from me, but rather to geue me some if I shoulde aske it of
you." By and by, this seruant thiefe casteth the cloke that he caried
on his arme about this poore mans face, that he should not marke or
vew them, with sharpe words to delyuer quicly that he had, and to
confesse truly what was in his purse. This poore man, then all
abashed, yelded, and confessed that he had but iust seuen shyllinges
in his purse; and the trouth is he knew of no more. This old
angell was falen out of a lytle purse into the botome of a great purse.
Now, this seuen shyllings in whyte money they quickly founde,
thinkinge in dede that there had bene no more; yet farther groping
and searchinge, found this old angell. And with great admiration,
this gentleman thyefe begane to blesse hym, sayinge, "good lorde,
what a worlde is this! howe maye" (quoth hée) "a man beleue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>or <span class="sidenote">HARMAN. A VPRIGHT MAN.</span>truste in the same? se you not" (quoth he) "this old knaue
tolde me that he had but seuen shyllings, and here is more by an
angell: what an old knaue and a false knaue haue we here!" quoth
this rufflar; "oure lorde haue mercy on vs, wyll this worlde neuer be
better?"&mdash;and there with went their waye. And lefte the olde man
in the wood, doinge him no more harme. But sorowfully sighinge,
this olde man, returning home, declared his misaduenture, with all
the words and circumstaunces aboue shewed. Wherat, for the tyme
was great laughing, and this poore man for his losses among his
louing neighboures well considered in the end.</p>

in most of these places aboue sayde. Yet, not with standinge
they haue so good lykinge in their lewed, lecherous loyteringe, that
full quiclye all their punishmentes is<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> for gotten. And repentaunce
is neuer thought vpon vntyll they clyme thrée tres with a ladder.
These vnrewly rascales, in their roylynge, disperse them selues into
seuerall companyes, as occation serueth, sometyme more and somtyme
lesse. As, if they repayre to a poore husbandmans house, hée wyll
go a lone, or one with him, and stoutely demaund his charytie,
eyther shewing how he hath serued in the warres, and their maymed,
eyther that he sekethe seruice, and saythe that he woulde be glad to
take payne for hys lyuinge, althoughe he meaneth nothinge lesse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>Yf he be offered any meate or drynke, he vtterlye refusethe scornefully,
and wyll nought but money; and yf he espye yong pyges or

after, hée wyll be sure to haue some of them, whyche they brynge to
their stawlinge kens, which is their typplyng houses, as well knowen
to them, according to the olde prouerbe, "as the begger knowes his
dishe." For you must vnderstand, euery Typplyng ale house wyll
neyther receiue them or their wares, but some certayne houses in euery
shyre, especially for that purpose, where they shalbe better welcome
to them then honester men. For by such haue they most gayne, and
shalbe conuayde eyther into some loft out of the waye, or other secret
corner not commen to any other; and thether repayre, at accustomed
tymes, their harlots, whiche they terme Mortes and Doxes,&mdash;not with
emty hands; for they be as skilfull in picking, riffling, <i>and</i> filching
as the vpright men, and nothing inferior to them in all kind of wyckednes,
as in other places hereafter they shalbe touched. At these
foresayde peltinge, peuish places and vnmannerly metinges, O! how
the pottes walke about! their talki<i>n</i>g tounges talke at large. They
bowle and bowse one to another, and for the tyme bousing belly
chere. And after there ruysting recreation, <span class="small">[leaf 7, back]</span> yf there be
not rome ynough in the house, they haue cleane strawe in some
barne or backehouse nere adioyning, where they couch comly to

haue his choyse, vnlesse for a lytle good maner; some wyll take
there owne that they haue made promyse vnto, vntyll they be out of
sight, and then, according to the old adage, "out of minde." Yet
these vpright men stand so much vpon their reputation, as they wyl
in no case haue their wemen walke with them, but seperat them
selues for a tyme, a moneth or more. And mete at fayres, or great
markets, where they mete to pylfer and steale from staules, shoppes,
or bothes. At these fayres the vpryght men vse commonly to lye
<i>and</i> lingar in hye wayes by lanes, some prety way or distaunce from
<i>th</i>e place, by which wayes they be assured that compeny passeth
styll two and fro. And ther they<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> wyll demaund, with cap in hand
and comly curtesy, the deuotion and charity of <i>th</i>e people. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>haue ben much lately whipped at fayrs. Yf they aske at a stout
yemans or farmars house his charity, they wyll goe strong as thre or
foure in a company. Where for feare more then good wyll, they
often haue reliefe. they syldome or neuer passe by a Iustices
house, but haue by wayes, vnlesse he dwell alone, and but weakely
manned; thether wyll they also go strong, after a slye, suttle sorte, as
with their armes bounde vp with kercher or lyste, hauinge wrapte
about the same filthy clothes, either their legges in such maner bewrapped
halting down right. Not vnprouided of good codg[e]ls,
which they cary to sustayne them, and, as they fayne, to kéepe
gogges<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> from them, when they come to such good gentlemens houses.
Yf any searche be made or they suspected for pylfring clothes of
hedgges, or breaking of houses, which they commonly do when the
owners bée eyther at the market, church, or other wayes occupyed
aboute their busines,&mdash;eyther robbe some sely man or woman by the
hye waye, as many tymes they do,&mdash;Then they hygh them into wodes,
great thickets, and other ruffe corners, where they lye lurkinge thre or
foure dayes to gether, and haue meate and drinke brought them by
theyre Mortes, and Doxes; and whyle they thus lye hydden in
couert, in the night they be not idle,&mdash;nether, as <i>th</i>e common saying
is, "well occupyed;" for then, as the wyly foxe, crepinge out of his
den, seketh his praye for pultery, so do these for lynnen and any
thinge els worth money, that lyeth about or near a house. As somtyme
a whole bucke of clothes caryed awaye at a tyme. When they
haue a greatter booty then they maye cary awaye quickly to their
stawling kendes, as is aboue sayd, They wyll hyde the same for a
thre dayes in some thicke couert, and <span class="small">[leaf 8]</span> in the night time carye
the same, lyke good water Spanlles, to their foresayd houses. To
whom they wyll discouer where or in what places they had the same,
where the markes shalbe pycked out cleane, <i>and</i> conuayed craftely
fare of, to sell. If the man or woman of the house want money
the<i>m</i> selues. <a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>If these vpright men haue nether money nor wares, at
these houses they shalbe trusted for their vitales, and it amount to
twentye or thirty shyllings. Yea, if it fortune any of these vpright
men to be taken, either suspected, or charged with fellony or petye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>brybrye, don at such a tyme or such a place, he wyll saye he was in
his hostes house. And if the man or wyfe of that house be examined
by an officer, they boldelye vouche, that the[y] lodged him
suche a tyme, whereby the truth cannot appeare. And if they
chaunce to be retained into seruice, through their lamentable words,
with any welthy man, They wyll tary but a smale tyme, either robbing
his maister or som of his fellowes. And some of them vseth this
polocye, that although they trauayle into al these shyres, aboue said,
yet wyl they haue good credite, espiciallye in one shyre, where at
diuers good farmars houses they be wel knowen, where they worke a
moneth in a place or more, and wyll for that time behaue them selues
very honestly <i>and</i> paynfully; And maye at any tyme, for their good
vsage, haue worke of them; and to these at a ded lyft, or last
refuge, they maye safely repayre vnto and be welcom, When in other
places, for a knacke of knauery that they haue playd, thei dare not
tary. These vyright men wil sildom or neuer want; for what is
gotten by anye Mort, or Doxe, if it please him, hée doth comaunde
the same. And if he mete any begger, whether he be sturdye or
impotent, he wyll demaund of him, whether euer he was stalled to
the roge or no. If he saye he was, he wyll know of whom, and his
name <i>tha</i>t stalled hym. And if he be not learnedly able to shewe
him the whole circumstaunce thereof, he wyll spoyle him of his
money, either of his best garment, if it be worth any money, and
haue him to the bowsing ken, Which is to some typpling house next
adioyninge; and laieth their to gage the best thing that he hath for
twenty pence or two shyllinges: this man obeyeth for feare of beating.
Then doth this vpright man call for a gage of bowse, whiche is
a quarte pot of drinke, and powres the same vpon his peld pate, adding
these words:&mdash;"I. G. P. do stalle thée W. T. to the Roge, and that
from hence forth it shall be lawefull for the to Cant"&mdash;that is, to
aske or begge&mdash;"for thy liuing in al places." Here you se <i>tha</i>t the
vpright man is of great auctorite. For all sortes of beggers are
obedient to his hests, and surmounteth all others in pylfring and
stealinge. ¶ I lately had standinge in my <span class="small">[leaf 8, back]</span> well house,
which standeth on the backeside of my house, a great cawdron of
copper, beinge then full of water, hauinge in the same halfe a doson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>of pewter dyshes, <span class="sidenote">HARMAN. A HOKER, OR ANGGLEAR.</span>well marked, and stamped w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the connizance of
my armes, whiche being well noted when they were taken out, were
set a side, the water powred out, and my caudren taken awaye, being
of such bygnes that one man, vnlesse he were of great strength, was
not able far to cary the same. Not withstandinge, the same was one
night within this two yeares conuayed more then half a myle from
my house, into a commen or heth, And ther bestowed in a great firbushe.
I then immediatly the next day sent one of my men to
London, and there gaue warning in Sothwarke, kent strete, and
Barmesey stréete, to all the Tynckars there dwelling,&mdash;That if any
such Caudron came thether to be sold, the bringar therof should be
stayed, and promised twenty shyllings for a reward. I gaue also intelligence
to the water men that kept the ferres, that no such vessel
should be ether conuayd to London or into essex, promysing the lyke
reward, to haue vnderstanding therof. This my doing was well
vnderstand in many places about, and that the feare of espyinge so
troubled <i>th</i>e conscience of the stealer, that my caudoren laye
vntouched in the thicke firbushe more then halfe a yeare after,
which, by a great chaunce, was found by hunteres for conneys; for
one chaunced to runne into the same bushe where my caudren was,
and being perceaued, one thrust his staffe into the same bushe, and
hyt my caudren a great blowe, the sound whereof dyd cause the
man to thinke and hope that there was some great treasure hidden,
wherby he thought to be the better whyle he lyued. And in farther
searching he found my caudren; so had I the same agayne vnloked
for.</p>

<p>¶ There was not long sithens two Roges that alwaies did associate
them selues together, <i>and</i> would neuer seperat them selues, vnles it
were for some especiall causes, for they were sworn brothers, <i>and</i>
were both of one age, and much like of favour: these two, trauelinge
into east kent, resorted vnto an ale house there,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> being weried with
traueling, saluting with short curtisey, when they came into the
house, such as thei sawe sitting there, in whiche company was the
parson of the parish; and callinge for a pot of the best ale, sat downe
at the tables ende: the lykor liked them so well, that they had pot
vpon pot, and sometyme, for a lytle good maner, would drinke and
offer the cup to such as they best fancied; and to be short, they sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>out al the company, for eche man departed home aboute their
busines. When they had well refreshed them selues, then these
rowsy roges requested the good man of the house wyth his wyfe to
sit downe and drinke with them, of whome they inquired what priest
the same was, and where he dwelt: then they fayninge that they
had an vncle a priest, and that he should dwel in these partes, which
by all presumptions it should be he, and that they came of purpose
to speake with hym, but because they had not sene hym sithens they
were sixe yeares olde, they durst not be bold to take acquayntance
of him vntyl they were farther instructed of the truth, and began to
inquier of his name, and how longe he had dwelt there, and how
farre his house was of from <i>th</i>e place they were in: the good wyfe of
the house, thynkinge them honest men without disceit, because they
so farre enquyred of their kinseman, was but of a good zelous naturall
intent, shewed them cherefully that hee <span class="small">[leaf 10]</span>  was an honest
man <i>and</i> welbeloued in the parish, and of good welth, <i>and</i> had ben
there resident xv. years at the least; "but," saith she, "are you both
brothers?" "yea, surely," said they, "we haue bene both in one
belly, <i>and</i> were twinnes." "Mercy, god!" q<i>uoth</i> this folish woman;
"it may wel be, for ye be not much vnlike,"&mdash;and wente vnto her
hall windowe, callinge these yong men vnto her, and loking out
therat,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> pointed with her fingar <i>and</i> shewed them the house standing

them, "he is not onely my vncle, but also my godfather." "It may
well be," q<i>uoth</i> she, "nature wyll bind him to be the better vnto

our vncle to-night; but to-morowe, god willinge, we wyll sée him
and do our duty: but, I pray you, doth our vncle occupy husbandry?
what company hath he in his house." "Alas!" saith she, "but one

this good wyfe, "you be mad men; go to him this night, for hée

you wyll vs: we wyl pause a whyle, and by that tyme it wylbe almost
night; <i>and</i> I praye you geue vs a reckeninge,"&mdash;so, manerly paying
for that they toke, bad their hoste and hostes farewell with takinge
leaue of the cup, marched merelye out of the dores towardes this
parsones house, vewed the same well rounde about, and passed by
two bowshotes of into a younge wodde, where they laye consultinge
what they shoulde do vntyll midnight. Quoth one of them, of
sharper wyt and subtyller then the other, to hys fellowe, "thou seest
that this house is stone walled about, and that we cannot well breake
in, in any parte thereof; thou seest also that the windowes be thicke
of mullions, that ther is no kreping in betwene: wherefore we must
of necessytie vse some policye when strength wil not serue. I haue
a horse locke here about me," saith he; "and this I hope shall serue
oure turne." So when it was aboute xii. of the clocke, they came to
the house and lurked nere vnto his chamber wyndowe: the dog of the
house barked a good, that with they<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> noise, this priest waketh out
of his sléepe, and began to cough and hem: then one of these roges
stepes forth nerer the window <i>and</i> maketh a ruful <i>and</i> pityful noise,
requiring for Christ sake<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> some reliefe, that was both hongry and
thirstye, and was like to ly with out the dores all nighte and starue
for colde, vnles he were releued by him with some small pece of
money. "Where dwellest thou?" quoth this parson. "Alas! sir,"
saithe this roge, "I haue smal <span class="small">[leaf 10, back]</span> dwelling, and haue com out
of my way; and I should now," saith he, "go to any towne nowe at
this time of night, they woulde set me in the stockes and punishe
me." "Well," quoth this pitifull parson, "away from my house,
either lye in some of my out houses vntyll the morning, and holde,
here is a couple of pence for thée." "A god rewarde you," quoth
this roge; "and in heauen may you finde it." The parson openeth
his wyndowe, and thrusteth out his arme to geue his almes to this
Roge that came whining to receiue it, and quickly taketh holde of his
hand, and calleth his fellowe to him, whiche was redye at hande with
the horse locke, and clappeth the same about the wrest of his arme,
that the mullions standing so close together for strength, that for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>life he could not plucke in his arme againe, and made him beleue,
vnles he would at the least geue them .iii. li., they woulde smite of
his arme from the body. So that this poore parson, in feare to lose
his hand, called vp his olde woman that lay in the loft ouer him,
and wylled her to take out all the money he had, which was iiij.
markes, which he saide was all the money in his house, for he had
lent vi. li. to one of his neighbours not iiij daies before. "Wel,"
q<i>uoth</i> they, "master parson, if you haue no more, vpon this condicion
we wil take of the locke, that you will drinke .xij. pence for
our sakes to-morow at the alehouse wher we found you, and thank
the good wife for the good chere she made vs." He promised faithfully
that he would so do; so they toke of the locke, and went their
way so farre ere it was daye, that the parson coulde neuer haue any
vnderstanding more of them. Now this parson, sorowfully slumbering
that night betwene feare and hope, thought it was but folly to
make two sorrowes of one; he vsed contentacion for his remedy, not
forgetting in the morning to performe his promise, but went betims
to his neighbour that kept tiplinge, and asked angerly where the
same two men were that dranke with her yester daye. "Which two
men?" q<i>uoth</i> this good wife. "The straungers that came in when I
was at your house wyth my neighbores yesterday." "What! your
neuewes?" q<i>uoth</i> she, "My neuewes?" q<i>uoth</i> this parson; "I
trowe thou art mad." "Nay, by god!" q<i>uoth</i> this good<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> wife, "as
sober as you; for they tolde me faithfully that you were their vncle:
but, in fayth, are you not so in dede? for, by my trouth, they are
strau[n]gers to me. I neuer saw them before." "O, out vpon
them!" q<i>uoth</i> the parson; "they be false theues, and this night
thei compelled me to geue them al the money in my house."
"Benedicite!" q<i>uoth</i> this good wife, "<i>and</i> haue they so in dede? as
I shall aunswere before god, one of them told me besides that you
were godfather to him, and that he trusted to haue your blessinge
before he departed." "What! did he?" quoth this parson; "a
halter blesse him for <span class="small">[leaf 11]</span> me!" "Me thinketh, by the masse, by
your countenance you loked so wildly when you came in," quoth
this good wife, "that somthing was amis." "I vse not to gest,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>quoth <span class="sidenote">HARMAN. A WYLDE ROGE.</span>this parson, "when I speake so earnestly." "Why, all your
sorrowes goe with it," quoth this good wife, "and sitte downe here,
and I will fil a freshe pot of ale shall make you mery agayne."

This peltynge Priggar, proude of his praye, walkethe his horse<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> vp

as he went for his horses that were walked, and began some what to

Then this Gentleman deligentlye enquired of thre or foure towne

<p>Apon Alhollenday in the morning last Anno domini. 1566, or
my<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> booke was halfe printed, I meane the first impression, there came
earely in the morninge a Counterfet Cranke vnder my lodgynge at the
whyte Fryares, wythin the cloyster, in a lyttle yard or coorte, where
aboutes laye two or thre great Ladyes, beyng without the lyberties of
London, where by he hoped for the greatter gayne; this Cranke there
lamentably lamentinge and pitefully crying to be releued, declared to
dyuers their hys paynfull and miserable dysease. I being rysen
and not halfe ready, harde his dolfull wordes and rufull mornings,
hering him name the falling sicknes, thought assuredlye to my selfe
that hée was a depe desemblar; so, comminge out at a sodayne, and
beholdinge his vgly and yrksome attyre, hys lothsome and horyble
countinance, it made me in a meruelous parplexite what to thinke of
hym, whether it were fayned or trouth,&mdash;for after this manner went
he: he was naked from the wast vpward, sauyng he had a old
Ierken<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of leather patched, and that was lose<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> about hym, that all
his bodye laye out bare; a filthy foule cloth he ware on his head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>being cut for the purpose, hauing a narowe place to put out his face,
with a bauer made to trusse vp his beard, and a stryng that tyed the
same downe close aboute his necke; with an olde felt hat which he
styll caried in his hande to receaue the charytye and deuotion of the
people, for that woulde he hold out from hym; hauyng hys face,
from the eyes downe ward, all smerd with freshe bloud, <span class="small">[leaf 15, back]</span>
as thoughe he had new falen, and byn tormented wyth his paynefull
panges,&mdash;his Ierken beinge all be rayde with durte and myre, and
hys hatte and hosen also, as thoughe hée hadde wallowed in the
myre: sewerly the sighte was monstrous and terreble. I called hym
vnto me, and demaunded of hym what he ayled. "A, good maister,"
quoth he, "I haue the greuous and paynefull dyseas called the
falynge syckenes." "Why," quoth I, "howe commeth thy Ierken,
hose, and hat so be rayd with durte and myre, and thy skyn also?"
"A, good master, I fell downe on the backesyde here in the fowle
lane harde by the watersyde; and there I laye all most all night,
and haue bled all most all the bloude owte in my bodye." It raynde
that morninge very fast; and whyle I was thus talkinge with hym, a
honest poore woman that dwelt thereby brought hym a fayre lynnen
cloth, and byd hym wype his face therewyth; and there beinge a tobbe
standing full of rayne water, offered to geue hym some in a dishe
that he might make hym selfe cleane: hée refuseth<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the same.
"Why dost thou so?" quoth I. "A, syr," sayth he, "yf I shoulde
washe my selfe, I shoulde fall to bléedinge a freshe againe, and then
I should not stop my selfe:" these wordes made me the more to
suspecte hym.</p>

<p>Then I asked of hym where he was borne, what is name was,
how longe he had this dysease, and what tyme he had ben here
about London, and in what place. "Syr," saythe he, "I was borne
at Leycestar, my name is Nycholas Genings,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and I haue had this
falling sycknes viij. yeares, and I can get no remedy for the same;
for I haue it by kinde, my father had it and my friendes before me;
and I haue byne these two yeares here about London, and a yeare
and a halfe in bethelem." "Why, wast thou out of thy wyttes?"
quoth I. "Ye, syr, that I was."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>"What is the Kepars name of the house?" "Hys name is,"
quoth hée, "Iohn Smith." "Then," quoth I, "hée must vnderstande
of thy dysease; yf thou hadest the same for the tyme thou
wast there, he knoweth it well." "Ye, not onely he, but all the
house bée syde," quoth this Cranke; "for I came thens but within
this fortnight." I had stande so longe reasoning the matter wyth
him that I was a cold, and went into my chamber and made me
ready, and commaunded my seruant to repayre to bethelem, and
bringe me true worde from the keper there whether anye suche man
hath byn with him as a prisoner hauinge the dysease aforesayd, and
gaue hym a note of his name and the kepars also: my seruant,
retorninge to my lodginge, dyd assure me that neither was there
euer anye such man there, nether yet anye keper of any suche
name; but hée that was there keper, he sent me hys name in writing,
afferming that hee letteth no man depart from hym vnlesse he be
fet a waye by <span class="small">[leaf 16]</span> hys fréendes, and that none that came from
hym beggeth aboute the Citye. Then I sent for the Printar of this
booke, and shewed hym of this dyssembling Cranke, and how I had
sent to Bethelem to vnderstand the trouth<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, and what aunsweare I
receaued againe, requiringe hym that I might haue some seruant
of his to watche him faithfully that daye, that I might vnder
stand trustely to what place he woulde repaire at night vnto, and
thether I promised to goe my selfe to sée their order, and that I
woulde haue hym to associate me thether: hée gladly graunted to
my request, and sent two boyes, that both diligently and vygelantly
accomplisht the charge geuen them, and found the same Cranke
aboute the Temple, where about the most parte of the daye hée
begged, vnlesse it weare about xii. of the clocke he went on the
backesyde of Clementes Ine without Temple barre: there is a lane
that goeth into the Feldes; there hee renewed his face againe wyth
freshe bloud, which he caried about hym in a bladder, and dawbed
on freshe dyrte vpon his Ierken, hat, and hoson.</p>

<p>¶ And so came backe agayne vnto the Temple, and sometyme to
the Watersyde, and begged of all that passed bye: the boyes behelde
howe some gaue grotes, some syxe pens, some gaue more;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>for hée looked so ougleie and yrksomlye, that euerye one pytied his
miserable case that beehelde hym. To bee shorte, there he passed all
the daye tyll night approched; and when it began to bée some what
dark, he went to the water syde and toke a Skoller,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and was sette
ouer the Water into Saincte Georges feldes, contrarye to my expectatian;
for I had thought he woulde haue gonne into Holborne or to
Saynt Gylles in the felde; but these boyes, with Argues and Lynces
eyes, set sewre watche vppon him, and the one tooke a bote and followed
him, and the other went backe to tell his maister.</p>

<p>The boye that so folowed hym by Water, had no money to pay
for his Bote hyre, but layde his Penner and his Ynkhorne to gage
for a penny; and by that tyme the boye was sette ouer, his Maister,
wyth all celeryte, hadde taken a Bote and followed hym apase: now
hadde they styll a syght of the Cranke, wych crossed ouer the
felddes towardes Newyngton, and thether he went, and by that tyme
they came thether it was very darke: the Prynter hadde there no
acquaintance, nether any kynde of weapon about hym, nether knewe
he<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> how farre the Cranke woulde goe, becawse hee then suspected
that they dogged hym of purposse; he there stayed hym, and called
for the Counstable, whyche came forthe dylygentelye to inquyre what
the matter was: thys zelous Pryntar charged thys offycer <span class="small">[leaf 16, back]</span>
wyth hym as a malefactor and a dessemblinge vagabonde&mdash;the
Counstable woulde haue layde him all night in the Cage that stode in
the streate. "Naye," saythe this pitifull Prynter, "I praye you haue
him into your house; for this is lyke to be a cold nyght, and he is
naked: you kepe a vytellinge house; let him be well cherished this
night, for he is well hable to paye for the same. I knowe well his
gaynes hath byn great to day, and your house is a sufficient pryson for
the tyme, and we wil there serche hym. The Counstable agreed
there vnto: they had him in, and caused him to washe him selfe:
that donne, they demaunded what money he had about hym. Sayth
this Cranke, "So God helpe me, I haue but xii. pence," and plucked
oute the same of a lytle pursse. "Why, haue you no more?"
quoth they. "No," sayth this Cranke, "as God shall saue my
soule at the day of iudgement." "We must se more," quoth they,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>and began to stryp hym. Then he plucked out a nother purse,
wherin was xl. pens. "Toushe," sayth<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> thys Prynter, "I must see
more." Saythe this Cranke, "I pray God I bée dampned both body<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
and soule yf I haue anye more." "No," sayth thys Prynter, "thou
false knaue, here is my boye that dyd watche thée all this daye, and
sawe when such men gaue the péeses of sixe pens, grotes, and other
money; and yet thou hast shewed vs none but small money."
When thys Cranke hard this, and the boye vowinge it to his face,
he relented, and plucked out another pursse, where in was eyght
shyllings and od money; so had they in the hole <i>that</i> he had
begged that day xiij. shillings iii. <a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>pens halfepeny<a name="FNanchor_106a_106a" id="FNanchor_106a_106a"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Then they
strypt him starke naked, and as many as sawe him sayd they neuer
sawe hansommer man, wyth a yellowe flexen beard<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>, and fayre

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcapb">{</span>
Thus he set<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> downe at the Chemnes end, and called for a<br />

<div class="noi">
<p class="chapstart">THese Dommerars are leud and most subtyll people: the moste
part of these are Walch men, and wyll neuer speake, vnlesse
they haue extreame punishment, but wyll gape, and with a
maruelous force wyll hold downe their toungs doubled, groning for
your charyty, and holding vp their handes full pitiously, so that with
their déepe dissimulation they get very much. There are of these
many, <i>and</i> but one that I vnderstand of hath lost his toung in dede.
Hauing on a time occasion to ride to Dartforde, to speake with a
priest there, who maketh all kinde of conserues very well, and vseth
stilling of waters; And repayringe to his house, I founde a Dommerar
at his doore, and the priest him selfe perusinge his<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> lycence,

the same to be good and effectuall. I taking the same writing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>reading it ouer, and noting the seales, founde one of the seales like
vnto a seale that I had aboute me, which seale I bought besides
Charing crosse, that I was out of doubte it was none of those Gentlemens
seales that had sub[s]cribed. And hauing vnderstanding
before of their peuish practises, made me to conceaue that all was
forged and nought. I made the more hast home; for well I wyst
that he would and must of force passe through the parysh where I
dwelt; for there was no other waye for hym. And comminge homewarde,
I found them in the towne, accordinge to my expectation,
where they were staid; for there was a Pallyarde associate with the
Dommerar and partaker of his gaynes, whyche Pallyarde I sawe not
at Dartford. The stayers of them was a gentleman called<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> <i>Chayne</i>,
and a seruant of my Lord Kéepers, cald <i>Wostestowe</i>, which was
<span class="small">[leaf 17, back]</span>  the chiefe causer of the staying of them, being a Surgien,
<i>and</i> cunning in his science, had séene the lyke practises, and, as he
sayde, hadde caused one to speake afore that was dome<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. It was my
chaunce to come at the begynning of the matter. "Syr," (quoth
this Surgien) "I am bold here to vtter some part of my cunning.
I trust" (quoth he) "you shall se a myracle wrought anon. For I
once" (quoth he) "made a dumme man to speake." Quoth I, "you
are wel met, and somwhat you haue preuented me; for I had
thought to haue done no lesse or they hadde passed this towne.
For I well knowe their writing is fayned, and they depe dissemblers."
The Surgien made hym gape, <i>and</i> we could sée but halfe
a toung. I required the Surgien to put hys fynger in his mouth,
<i>and</i> to pull out his toung, and so he dyd, not withstanding he held
strongly a prety whyle; at the length he pluckt out the same, to the
great admiration of many that stode by. Yet when we sawe his
tounge, hée would neither speake nor yet could heare. Quoth I to
the Surgien, "knit two of his fyngers to gether, and thrust a stycke
betwene them, and rubbe the same vp and downe a lytle whyle, and
for my lyfe hée speaketh by and by."  "Sir," quoth this Surgien,
"I praye you let me practise and<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> other waye." I was well contented
to sée the same. He had him into a house, and tyed a halter aboute
the wrestes of his handes, and hoysed him vp ouer a beame, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>there dyd <span class="sidenote">HARMAN. A PRYGGE.</span>let him hang a good while: at <i>th</i>e length, for very paine
he required for Gods sake to let him down. So he that was both
deafe and dume coulde in short tyme both heare and speake. Then
I tooke that money I could find in his pursse, and distributed the
same to the poore people dwelling there, whiche was xv. pence halfepeny,
being all that we coulde finde. That done, and this merry
myracle madly made, I sent them with my seruaunt to the next
Iusticer, where they preached on the Pyllery for want of a Pulpet,
and were well whypped, and none dyd bewayle them.</p>

<p>¶ A Demaunder for glymmar came vnto a good towne in Kente,
to aske the charitie of the people, hauinge a fayned lycens aboute
her that declared her misfortune by fyre, donne in Somerset shyre,
walkinge with a wallet on her shoulders, where in shée put the deuotion
of suche as hadde no money to geue her; that is to saye,
Malte, woll, baken, bread, and cheese; and alwayes, as the same was
full, so was it redye money to her, when she emptyed the same,
where so euer shee trauelede: thys harlot was, as they terme it,
snowte fayre, and had an vpright man or two alwayes attendinge on
her watche (whyche is on her parson), and yet so circumspecte, that
they woulde neuer bee séene in her company in any good towne,
vnlesse it were in smale vyllages where typling houses weare, eyther
trauelinge to gether by the hygh wayes; but <i>th</i>e troth is, by report,
she would wekely be worth vi. or seuen shyllinges with her begging
and bycherye. This glimmering Morte, repayringe to an Ine in <i>th</i>e
sayde towne where dwelt a wydow of fyftie wynter olde of good
welth; but she had an vnthryftye sonne, whom she vsed as a
chamberlaine to attend gestes when they repared to her house: this
amerous man, be holdinge with ardante eyes thys<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> glymmeringe

easlye perswaded to lykinge lechery, and as a man mased, mused
howe to attayne to his purpose, for<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> he hadde no money. Yet consideringe
wyth hym selfe that wares woulde bée welcome where
money wanted, hée went with a wannion to his mothers chamber,
and there sekinge aboute for odde endes, at length founde a lytle
whystell of syluer that his mother dyd vse customablye to weare on,
and had forgot the same for haste that morninge, and offeres the
same closely to this manerly marian, that yf she would mete hym on
the backesyde of the towne and curteously kys him with out constraynt,
she shoulde bée mystres thereof, and it weare much better.
"Well," sayth she, "you are a wanton;" and beholdinge the
whystell, was farther in loue there with then rauysht wyth his
person, and agred to mete him presently, and to accomplyshe his
fonde fancy:&mdash;to be short, and not tedyous, a quarter of a myle from
the towne, he merely toke measure of her vnder a bawdye bushe; so
she gaue hym that she had not, and he receiued that he coulde not;
and taking leue of eche other with a curteous kysse, she plesantly
passed forth one her iornaye, <i>and</i> this vntoward lycorous chamberlayne
repayred home warde. But or these two tortylles tooke there
leue, the good wyfe myssed her whystell, and sent one of her
maydenes in to her chamber for the same, and being long sawght
for, none coulde be founde; her mystres hering that, diligent search
was made for the same; and that it was taken awaye, began to suspecte
her vnblessed babe, and demaunded of her maydens whether
none of them sawe her sonne in her chamber that morning, and one
of them aunswered that she sawe him not there, but comming from
thens: then had she ynough, for well she wyste that he had the
same, and sent for him, but he could not be founde. Then she
caused her hosteler, in whome she had better affyaunce in for his
trouth,&mdash;and yet not one amongst twenty of them but haue well
left there honesty, (As I here a great sorte saye)&mdash;to come vnto
her, whiche attended to knowe her pleasure. "Goe, seke out,"
saythe she, "my vntowarde sonne, and byd hym come speake
with me."  "I sawe him go out," saythe he, "halfe an houre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>sithens one the backesyde. I hadde thought you hadde sent him
of your arrante." "I sent him not," quoth she; "goe, loke him
out."</p>

<p>¶ This hollowe hosteler toke his staffe in his necke, and trodged
out apase that waye he sawe him before go, and had some vnderstanding,
by one of the maydens, that his mistres had her whistell stolen
<i>and</i> suspected her sonne; and he had not gone farre but that he
espyed him comming homeward alone, and, meting him, axed where he
had ben. <span class="small">[leaf 19, back]</span> "Where haue I bene?" q<i>uoth</i> he, and began
to smyle. "Now, by the mas, thou hast bene at some baudy
banquet." "Thou hast euen tolde trouth," q<i>uoth</i> thys chamberlayne.
"Sewerly," q<i>uoth</i> this hosteler, "thou haddest the same
woman that begged at our house to day, for <i>th</i>e harmes she had by
fyre: where is she?" q<i>uoth</i> he. "She is almost a myle by this
tyme," q<i>uoth</i> this chamberlayne. "Where is my mystres whystell?"
quoth this hosteler; "for I am well assured that thou haddest it,
and I feare me thou hast geuen it to that harlot." "Why! is it
myssed?" <i>quoth</i> this chamberlayne. "Yea," q<i>uoth</i> this hosteler,
and shewed him all the hole circumstaunce, what was both sayde
and thought on him for the thing. "Well, I wyl tell the," quoth
this Chamberlayne. "I wylbe playne with the. I had it in dede,
and haue geue<i>n</i> the same to this woman, and I praye the make the
best of it, and helpe nowe to excuse the matter, and yet surely
and thou wouldest take so much payne for me as to ouer take her,
(for she goeth but softly, and is not yet farre of) and take the same
from her, and I am euer thyne assured fréende." "Why, then, go
with me," quoth this hostler. "Nay, in faythe," quoth this Chamberlayne;
"what is frear then gift? and I hadde prety pastime for the
same." "Hadest thou so?" quoth this hosteler; "nowe, by the
masse, and I wyll haue some to, or I wyll lye in the duste or I come
agayne." Passing with hast to ouer take this paramoure, within a
myle fro<i>m</i> <i>th</i>e place where he departed he ouertoke her, hauing an
vpright man in her company, a stronge and a sturdye vacabond:
some what amased was this hosteler to se one familiarly in her company,
for he had well hopped to haue had some delycate dalyance,
as his fellowe hadde; but, seinge the matter so fallout, and being of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>good corage, and thinking to him selfe that one true man was better
then two false knaues, and being on the high way, thought vpon
helpe, if nede had bene, by such as had passed to and fro, Demaunded
fersely the whistell that she had euyn nowe of his fellowe.
"Why, husband," quoth she, "can you suffer this wretche to
slaunder your wyfe?" "A vaunt verlet," quoth this vpright man,
and letes dryue with all his force at this hosteler, and after halfe<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
a dosen blowes, he strycks his staffe out of his hande, and as this
hosteler stept backe to haue taken vp his staffe agayne, his glymmeringe
Morte flinges a great stone at him, and strake him one the heade
that downe hee fales, wyth the bloud about his eares, and whyle hée
laye this amased, the vpright man snatches awaye his pursse, where
in hée hadde money of his mystresses as well as of his owne, and
there let him lye, and went a waye with spede that they were neuer
harde of more. When this drye beaten hosteler was come to him
selfe, hée fayntlye wandereth home, and crepethe in to hys couche,
and restes <span class="small">[leaf 20]</span> his ydle heade: his mystres harde that hée was
come in, and layde him downe on his beade, repayred straight vnto
him, and aske hym what he ayled, and what the cause was of his so
sudden lying one his bed. "What is the cause?" quoth this
hosteler; "your whystell, your whistel,"&mdash;speaking the same
pyteouslye thre or foure tymes. "Why, fole," quoth his mystrisse,
"take no care for that, for I doe not greatly waye it; it was worth
but thrée shyllinges foure pens." "I would it had bene burnt for
foure yeares agon." "I praye the why so," quoth his mystres; "I
think thou art mad." "Nay, not yet," quoth this hosteler, "but I
haue bene madly handlyd." "Why, what is the matter?" quoth
his mystres, and was more desirous to know the case. "<i>And</i> you
wyl for geue my fellowe and me, I wyll shewe you, or els I wyll
neuer doe it." Shée made hym presently faithfull promisse that shée
woulde. "Then," saythe hee, "sende for your sonne home agayne,
whyche is ashamed to loke you in the face." "I agre there to,"
sayth shée "Well, then," quoth this hosteler, "youre sonne hathe
geuen the same Morte that begged here, for the burninge of her
house, a whystell, and you haue geuen her v. shyllinges in money,

so?" quoth she. Then he sadly shewed her of his myshap, with all
the circumstaunce that you haue harde before, and howe hys pursse
was taken awaye, and xv. shyllinges in the same, where of v. shyllinges
was her money and x. shyllinges his owne money. "Is this
true?" quoth his mystres. "I, by my trouth," quoth this hosteler,
"and nothing greues me so much, neyther my beating, neither the
losse of my money, as doth my euell <i>and</i> wreched lucke." "Why,
what is the matter?" quoth his mystres. "Your sonne," saythe
this hosteler, "had some chere and pastyme for that whystell, for he
laye with her, and I haue bene well beaten, and haue had my pursse
taken from me, and you knowe your sonne is merrye and pleasaunt,
and can kepe no great councell; and then shall I bemocked <i>and</i>
loughed to skorne in all places when they shall here howe I haue

<p>¶ The last Sommer, Anno domini .1566, being in familiare
talke with a walking Mort that came to my gate, I learned by her
what I could, and I thought I had gathered as much for my purpose
as I desired. I began to rebuke her for her leud lyfe and beastly
behauor, declaring to her what punishment was prepared and heaped
vp for her in the world to come for her fylthy lyuinge and wretched
conuersation. "God helpe," q<i>uoth</i> she, "how should I lyue? none
wyll take me into seruice; but I labour in haruest time honestly."
"I thinke but a whyle with honestie," q<i>uoth</i> I. "Shall I tell you,"
q<i>uoth</i> she, "the best of vs all may be amended; but yet, I thanke
god, I dyd one good dede within this twelue mo<i>n</i>thes." "Wherein?"
q<i>uoth</i> I. Sayth she, "I woulde not haue it spoken of agayne."
"Yf it be méete and necessary," q<i>uo</i>d I, "it shall lye vnder my
feete." "What meane you by that?" quoth she. "I meane," q<i>uo</i>d
I, "to hide the same, and neuer to discouer it to any." "Well,"
q<i>uoth</i> she, and began to laugh as much as she could, and sweare by
the masse that if I disclosed the same to any, she woulde neuer more<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
tell me any thinge. "The last sommer," q<i>uoth</i> she, "I was greate
with chylde, and I traueled into east kent by the sea coste, for I
lusted meruelously after oysters and muskels<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, and gathered many,
and in <i>th</i>e place where I found them, I opened them and eate them
styll: at the last, in seking more, I reached after one, and stept into
a hole, and fel in into the wast, and their dyd stycke, and I had
bene drowned if the tide had come, and espyinge a man a good waye
of, I cried as much as I could for helpe. I was alone, he hard
me, and repaired as fast to me as he might, and finding me their fast
stycking, I required for gods sake his helpe; and whether it was with
stryuinge and forcing my selfe out, or for ioye I had of his comminge
to me, I had a great couller in my face, and loked red and well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>coullered. And, to be playne with you, hée lyked me so well (as he
sayd) that I should there lye styll, and I would not graunt him, that
he might lye with me. And, by my trouth, I wist not what to
answeare, I was in such a perplexite; for I knew the man well: he
had a very honest woman to his wyfe, and was of some welth; and,
one the other syde, if I weare not holpe out, I should there haue
perished, and I graunted hym that I would obeye to his wyll: then
he plucked me out. And because there was no conuenient place nere
hande, I required hym that I might go washe my selfe, and make me
somewhat clenly, and I would come to his house and lodge all night
in his barne, whether he mighte repaire to me, and accomplyshe hys
desire, 'but let it not be,' quoth she,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> 'before nine of the clocke at

this was about two of the clocke in the after none, 'Do so,' quoth
hée; 'for I must be busie to looke oute my cattell here by before I
can come home.' So I went awaye from hym, and glad was I."
"And why so?" quoth I. "Because," quoth she, "his wyfe, my
good dame, is my very fréend, and I am much beholdinge to her.
And she hath donne me so much good or this, that I weare loth nowe
to harme her any waye." "Why," quoth I, "what and it hadde
béene any other man, and not your good dames husbande?" "The
matter had bene the lesse," quoth shée. "Tell me, I pray the,"
quoth I, "who was the father of thy chylde?" She stodyd a whyle,
and sayde that it hadde a father. "But what was hée?" quoth I.
"Nowe, by my trouth, I knowe not," quoth shée; "you brynge me
out of my matter so, you do." "Well, saye on," quoth I. "Then I
departed strayght to the towne, and came to my dames house, And
shewed her of my mysfortune, also of her husbands vsage, in all
pointes, and that I showed her the same for good wyll, and byde her
take better héede to her husbande, and to her selfe: so shée gaue me

from her gossypes, she shewed them at what houre they should
preuely come in on <i>th</i>e backsid, <i>and</i> where to tary their good our:
so by <i>th</i>e time she came in, it was all most night, and found the walking
Morte still setting by the fyre, and declared to her all this new

yf she haue eate and dronke, send her into the barne to her lodging
for this night, for she troubeleth the house." "Euen as you wyll

"to your lodginge." "Yes, good dame," sayth she, "as fast as I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>him downe, and was very plesant, and dranke to his wyfe, <i>and</i> fell

to the prouerbe, that swete meate wyll haue sowre sawce: thus, whe<i>n</i>
he was well refreshed, his sprietes being reuyued, entred into familiare

that daye to both there proffytes, sayinge some of his cattell<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> were
lyke to haue bene drowned in the dyches, dryuinge others of his
neyghbours cattell out that were in his pastures, <i>and</i> mending his
fences that were broken downe. Thus profitably he had consumed
the daye, nothinge talking of his helping out of the walkinge Morte
out of the myre, nether of his request nor yet of her<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> promisse.
Thus feding her w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> frendly fantacyes, consumed two houres and
more. Then fayninge howe hée would se in what case his horse
were in and howe they were dressed, Repaired couertly into the
barne, where as his frée[n]dlye foes lyrked preuely, vnlesse it were
this manerly Morte, that comly couched on a bottell of strawe.
"What, are you come?" q<i>uoth</i> she; "by the masse, I would not
for a hundreth pound that my dame should knowe that you were
here, eyther any els of your house." "No, I warrant the," sayth
this good man, "they be all safe and fast ynough at their woorke,

would haue had to do w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her. "Nay, fye," sayth she, "I lyke
not this order: if ye lye with me, you shall surely vntrus you <i>and</i>
put downe your hosen, for that way is most easiest and best."
"Sayest thou so?" quoth he, "now, by my trouth agred." And
when he had vntrussed him selfe and put downe, he began to assalt
the vnsatiable<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> fort "Why," quoth she, that was with out shame,

eyes, that he shoulde not sée; and when they had made hym sure
and fast, Then they layd him one vntyll they weare windles. "Be
good," sayth this Morte, "vnto my maister, for the passion of God,"
<span class="small">[leaf 23, back]</span> and layd on as fast as the rest, and styll seased not to
crye vpon them to bée mercyfull vnto hym, and yet layde on a pace;
and when they had well beaten hym, that the bloud braste plentifullye
oute in most places, they let hym lye styll bounde. With
this exhortation, that he shoulde from that tyme forth knowe his
wyfe from other mens, and that this punishment was but a flebyting
in respect of that which should followe, yf he amended not his
manners. Thus leuynge hym blustering, blowing, and fominge for
payne, and malyncolye that hée neither might or coulde be reuenged
of them, they vanyshed awaye, and hadde thys Morte with them,
and safely conuayde her out of the towne: sone after co<i>m</i>meth into
the barne one of the good mans boyes, to fet some haye for his horse.
And fyndinge his maister lyinge faste bounde and greuouslye beaten
with rodes, was sodenly abashed and woulde haue runne out agayne
to haue called for helpe; but his maister bed hym come vnto hym
and vnbynd hym; "and make no wordes," quoth he, "of this. I
wylbe reuenged well inoughe;" yet not with standinge, after better
aduyse, the matter beinge vnhonest, he thought it meter to let the
same passe, and, not, as the prouerbe saythe, to awake the sleping
dogge. "And, by my trouth," quoth this walkinge Morte, "I come
nowe from that place, and was neuer there sythens this parte was
playde, whiche is some what more then a yeare. And I here a very
good reporte of hym now, that he loueth his wyfe well, and vseth
hym selfe verye honestlye; and was not this a good acte? nowe, howe
saye you?" "It was pretely handeled," quoth I, "and is here all?"
"Yea," quoth she, "here is the ende."</p>

I chaunced, not longe sithens, familiarly to commen with a

pleasant as wytty, and not so wytty as voyd of all grace and goodnes.
I founde, by her talke, that shée hadde passed her tyme lewdlye
eyghttene yeares in walkinge aboute. I thoughte this a necessary
instrument to attayne some knowledge by; and before I woulde
grope her mynde, I made her both to eate and drynke well; that
done, I made her faythfull promisse to geue her some money, yf she
would open and dyscouer to me such questions as I woulde demaunde

"And you shoulde," sayth she, "I were vndon:" "feare not that,"

"I wyll not," sayth shée. "Then, fyrste tell me," quoth I, "how

a whyle, and sayd, "why do you aske me, or wherefore?" "For

sayde they were hanged. "What, all?" quoth I, "and so manye
walke abroade, as I dayelye see?" "By my trouth," quoth she, "I

a gone, some thrée yeares, and some w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this fortnight," and declared
the place where they weare executed, which I knewe well to
bée true, by the report of others. "Why" (quoth I) "dyd not this
sorrowfull and fearefull sight much greue the, and for thy tyme longe
and euyll spent?" "I was sory," quoth shée, "by the Masse; for
some of them were good louing men. For I lackt not when they
had it, and they wanted not when I had it, and diuers of them I
neuer dyd forsake, vntyll the Gallowes departed vs." "O, mercyfull
God!" quoth I, and began to blesse me. "Why blesse ye?" quoth
she. "Alas! good gentleman, euery one muste haue a lyuinge."
Other matters I talked of; but this nowe maye suffice to shewe

him selfe, for he had both house and wife in the same parishe, as after you
shall heare. But this lewde lewterar could not laye his bones to labour, hauing
got once the tast of this lewd lasy lyfe, for al this fayr admonition, but deuised
other suttel sleights to maintaine his ydell liuing, and so craftely clothed
him selfe in mariners apparel, and associated him self with an other of his
companions: they hauing both mariners apparel, went abroad to aske charity
of <i>th</i>e people, fayning they hadde loste their shippe with all their goods by
casualty on the seas, wherewith they gayned much. This crafty Cranke,
fearinge to be mistrusted, fell to another kinde of begging, as bad or worse, and
apparelled himselfe very well with a fayre black fréese cote, a new payre of
whyte hose, a fyne felt hat on his head, a shert of flaunders worke esteemed to
be worth xvi. shillings; and vpon newe yeares day came againe into the whyt
Fryers to beg: the printer, hauing occasion to go that ways, not thinking of
this Cranke, by chaunce met with him, who asked his charitie for Gods sake.
The printer, vewing him well, did mistrust him to be the counterfet Cranke
which deceuied him vpon Alhollen daye at night, demaunded of whence he was
and what was his name. 'Forsoth,' saith he, 'my name is Nicolas Genings,
and I came from Lecester to séeke worke, and I am a hat-maker by my occupation,
and all my money is spent, and if I coulde get money to paye for my
lodging this night, I would seke work to morowe amongst the hatters.'  The
printer perceiuing his depe dissimulation, putting his hand into his purse, seeming
to giue him some money, and with fayre allusions brought him into the
stréete, where he charged the constable with him, affirminge him to be the
counterfet Cranke that ranne away vpon Alholon daye last. The constable
being very loth to medle with him, but the printer knowing him and his depe
disceit, desyred he mought be brought before the debutie of the ward, which
straight was accomplished, which whe<i>n</i> he came before the debuty, he demaunded
of him of whence he was and what was his name; he answered as
before he did vnto <i>th</i>e printer: the debutie asked the printer what he woulde
laye vnto hys charge; he answered and aleged him to be a vagabond and depe
deceyuer of the people, and the counterfet Crank that ran away vpon Alhallon
day last from the constable of Newington and him, and requested him
earnestly to send him to ward: the debuty thinking him to be deceiued, but
neuerthelesse laid his co<i>m</i>maundement vpon him, so that the printer should
beare his charges if he could not iustifie it; he agréed thereunto. And so he
and the constable went to cary him to the Counter: and as they were going
vnder Ludgate, this crafty Cranke toke his héeles and ran down the hill as fast
as he could dryve, the constable and the printer after him as fast as they
coulde; but the printer of <i>th</i>e twayn being lighter of fote, ouertoke him at
fleete bridge, and with strong hand caried him to the counter, and safely deliuered
him. In <i>th</i>e morow <i>th</i>e printer sent his boy that stripped him vpon Alhalon
day at night to view him, because he would be sure, which boy knew him
very well: this Crank confessed unto the debuty, <i>tha</i>t he had hosted the night
before in Kent stréet in Southwarke, at the sign of the Cock, which thing to be
true, the printer sente to know, and found him a lyer; but further inquiring,
at length found out his habitation, dwelling in maister Hilles rentes, hauinge
a pretye house, well stuffed, with a fayre ioyne table, and a fayre cubbard
garnished with peuter, hauing an old auncient woman to his wyfe. The printer
being sure therof, repaired vnto the Counter, and rebuked him for his beastly
behaviour, and told him of his false fayning, willed him to confesse it, and
aske forgivenes: he perceyued him to know his depe dissimulation, relented,
and confessed all his disceit; and so remayning in the counter thrée dayes,
was removed to Brydwel, where he was strypt starke naked, and his ougly
attyre put vpo<i>n</i> him before the maisters thereof, who wondered greatly at his
dissimulation: for which offence he stode vpon the pillery in Cheapsyde, both
in his ougly and handsome attyre. And after that went in the myll whyle his
ougly picture was a drawing; and then was whypped at a cartes tayle through
London, and his displayd banner caried before him vnto his own dore, and so
backe to Brydewell again, and there remayned for a tyme, and at length let
at libertie, on that condicio<i>n</i> he would proue an houest man, and labour truly
to get his liuing. And his picture remayneth in Bridewell for a monyment."&mdash;See,

Whoe is he then that will not Iudge theves vertuous, most stoute,
most hardye? I most, without<i>e</i> feare. As for stealinge, that is a
thinge vsuall:&mdash;who<i>e</i> stealeth not? ffor not only you that haue
besett me, but many other in many places. Men, Woemen, <i>and</i>
Children, Riche and poore, are dailye of that facultye, As the hange

is euident in many storyes of the Scriptures. And if you liste to
looke in the whole Course of the bible, you shall finde that theves
haue bin belovid of god. ffor Iacobe, when he Came oute of Mesopotomia,
did steale his vncles lambes; the same Iacobe stale his
brother Esawes blessinge; and that god saide, "I haue chosen Iacob
and refused Esawe." The Children of Isarell, when they came
oute of Egippe, didd steale the Egippsians Iewells and ring<i>es</i>, and
god comaunded the[m] soe to doe. David, in the dayes of Ahemel[e]ch
the preiste, came into the temple and stole awaye the shewe
bread; And yet god saide, "this is a man accordinge to myne owne
harte." Alsoe Christe himsellfe, when he was here vppon earth, did
take an asse, a Colte, which was none of his owne. And you knowe
that god saide, "this is my now<i>n</i>e sone, in whome I delighte."</p>

<p>Thus maye you see that most of all god delighteth in theves. I
marvell, therefore, that men can despise yo<i>ur</i> lives, when that you
are in all poynts almost like vnto Christe; for Christ hade noe dwellinge
place,&mdash;noe more haue you. Christe, therefore, at the laste, was
laide waite for in all places,&mdash;and soe are you. Christe alsoe at the
laste was called for,&mdash;and soe shall you be. He was condemned,&mdash;soe
shall you be. Christe was hanged,&mdash;soe shall you be. He descended
into hell,&mdash;so shall you. But in one pointe you differ. He
assendid into heaven,&mdash;soe shall you never, without gods mercye,
Which god graunte for his mercyes sake! Toe whome, with the so<i>n</i>ne

not the least worthie of noting, especially of those that trade to
Faires and Markets, that therby being warned, they may likewise be
armed, both to see the deceit, and shun the daunger. These shifters
will come vnto an Inne or vittailing house, that is most vsed in the
towne, and walke vp and downe; and if there come any gentleman
or other, to lay vp either cloke, sword, or any other thing woorth the
hauing, then one of this crue taketh the marks of the thing, or at
least the token the partie giueth them: anone, after he is gone, he
likewise goeth forth, and with a great countenance commeth in againe
to the mayde or seruant, calling for what another left: if they doubt
to deliuer it, then hee frets, and calles them at his pleasure, and tels
them the markes and tokens: hauing thus done, hee blames their forgetfulnes,
and giues them a couple of pence to buy them pinnes,
bidding them fetch it straight, and know him better the next time,
wherewith they are pleasd, and he possest of his pray. Thus one
gotte a bagge of Cheese the last Sturbridge Faire; for in such places
(as a reclaimd fellow of that crue confessed) they make an ordinary
practise of the same.</p>

<h5>THE VISITER.</h5>

<p>An honest youth, not many yeares since, seruant in this City, had
leaue of his master at whitsontide to see his friends, who dwelt some
fifty miles from London. It hapned at a Country wake, his mother
and hee came acquainted with a precise scholler, that, vnder colour
of strickt life, hath bin reputed for that hee is not: hee is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>knowen in Paules Churchyard, and hath beene lately a visiting in
Essex; for so he presumes to tearme his cosening walks: and therefore
wee will call him here a Visiter. This honest seeming man
must needes (sith his iourney lay to London) stay at the yong mans
mothers all the holy daies: where as on his desert hee was kindly
vsed; at length, the young man, hauing receiued his mother's blessing,
with other his friendes giftes, amounting to some ten poundes,
was to this hypocrite as to a faithful guide committed, and toward
London they ride: by the way this Visiter discourses how excellent
insight he had in Magick, to recouer by Art anything lost or stolne.
Well, to sant Albons they reach; there they sup together, and, after
the carowsing of some quarts of wine, they go to bed, where they
kindly sleepe,&mdash;the Visiter slily, but the young man soundly. Short
tale to make&mdash;out of his bed-fellow's sleeue this Visiter conuaid his
twenty Angels, besides some other od siluer, hid it closely, and so
fell to his rest. Morning comes&mdash;vp gets this couple&mdash;immediately
the money was mist, much adoo was made; the Chamberlaine with
sundry other seruants examined; and so hot the contention, that the
good man, for the discharge of his house, was sending for a Constable
to haue them both first searcht, his seruants Chests after. In the
meane time the Visiter cals the yong man aside, and bids him neuer
grieue, but take horse; and he warrants him, ere they be three miles
out of towne, to helpe him to his money by Art, saying:&mdash;"In these
Innes ye see how we shall be out-faced, and, beeing vnknowne, how
euer we be wrongd, get little remedy." The yong man, in good
hope, desired him to pay the reckoning, which done, together they
ride. Being some two miles from the towne, they ride out of the
ordinary way: there he tels this youth how vnwilling hee was to
enter into the action, but that it was lost in his company, and so
forth. Well, a Circle was made, wondrous words were vsed, many
muttrings made: at length hee cries out,&mdash;"vnder a greene turfe, by
the East side of an Oake; goe thither, goe thither." This thrice he
cryed so ragingly, as the yuong man gest him mad, and was with
feare almost beside himself. At length, pausing, quoth this Visiter,
"heard ye nothing cry?" "Cry!" said the yong man, "yes;
<span class="small">[leaf 5, back]</span> you cride so as, for twise ten pound, I would not heare ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>again." "Then," <span class="sidenote">A SHIFTER DESCRIBED.</span>quoth he, "'tis all well, if ye remember the
words." The yong man repeated them. With that this shifter said,
"Go to the furthest Oke in the high-way towards S. Albons, and
vnder a greene turfe, on the hither side, lyes your mony, and a note
of his name that stole it. Hence I cannot stirre till you returne;
neyther may either of our horses be vntide for that time: runne yee
must not, but keepe an ordinary pace." Away goes the yong man
gingerly; and, being out of sight, this copesmate takes his cloke-bag,
wherein was a faire sute of apparel, and, setting spurres to his horse,
was, ere the Nouice returned, ridde cleane out of his view. The
yong man, seeing himselfe so coossened, made patience his best
remedie, tooke his horse, and came to London, where yet it was neuer
his lucke to meet this visiter.</p>

<h5>A SHIFTER.</h5>

<p>A Shifter, not long since, going ordinarily booted, got leaue of a
Carrier to ride on his owne hackney a little way from London, who,
comming to the Inne where the Carier that night should lodge,
honestly set vp the horse, and entred the hal, where were at one
table some three and thirty clothiers, all returning to their seuerall
countries. Vsing, as he could, his curtesie, and being Gentleman-like
attirde, he was at all their instance placed at the vpper end by
the hostesse. After hee had a while eaten, he fel to discourse with
such pleasance, that all the table were greatly delighted therewith.
In the midst of supper enters a noise of musitions, who with their
instruments added a double delight. For them hee requested his
hostesse to laye a shoulder of mutton and a couple of capons to the
fire, for which he would pay, <i>and</i> then mooued in their behalfe to
gather. Among them a noble was made, which he fingring, was well
blest; for before he had not a crosse, yet he promist to make it vp
an angel. To be short, in comes the reckoning, which (by reason of
the fine fare <i>and</i> excesse of wine) amounted to each mans halfe crown.
Then hee requested his hostesse to prouide so many possets of sacke,
as would furnish the table, which he would bestow on the Gentlemen
to requite their extraordinary costs: <i>and</i> iestingly askt if she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>make him her deputie to gather the reckoning; she graunted, and he
did so: and on a sodaine, (faining to hasten his hostesse with the
possets) he tooke his cloke, and, finding fit time, hee slipt out of
doores, leauing the guestes and their hostesse to a new reckoning,
<i>and</i> the musitians to a good supper, but they paid for the sauce.
This iest some vntruly attribute to a man of excellent parts about
London, but he is slandered: the party that performed it hath scarce
any good qualitie to liue. Of these sort I could set downe a great
number, but I leaue you now vnto those which by Maister Harman
are discouered.</p>

died in 1567, and was buried in the parish church of Erith. "The

lane, so called, not only of <i>a sign of three cranes at a tavern door</i>, but
rather of three strong cranes of timber placed on the Vintry wharf by
the Thames side, to crane up wines there, as is afore showed. This
lane was of old time, to wit, the 9th of Richard II., called The Painted
Tavern lane, of the tavern being painted."&mdash;Stow's <i>Survey of London</i>,
ed. by Thoms, p. 90.</p>

<p>"The Three Cranes was formerly a favourite London sign. With
the usual jocularity of our forefathers, an opportunity for punning could
not be passed; so, instead of the three cranes, which in the vintry used
to lift the barrels of wine, three birds were represented. The Three Cranes
in Thames Street, or in the vicinity, was a famous tavern as early as the
reign of James I. It was one of the taverns frequented by the wits in
Ben Jonson's time. In one of his plays he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A pox o' these pretenders! to wit, your <i>Three Cranes</i>, Mitre and Mermaid
men! not a corn of true salt, not a grain of right mustard among
them all!'&mdash;<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, act i. sc. 1.</p>

<p>"On the 23rd of January, 1661/2 Pepys suffered a strong mortification
of the flesh in having to dine at this tavern with some poor relations.
The sufferings of the snobbish secretary must have been intense:&mdash;</p>

<p>'By invitation to my uncle Fenner's, and where I found his new
wife, a <i>pitiful, old, ugly, ill-bred</i> woman in a hatt, a mid-wife. Here
were many of his, and as many of her, relations, <i>sorry, mean people</i>; and
after choosing our gloves, we all went over to the Three Cranes Taverne;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>and though the best room of the house, in such a narrow dogghole we
were crammed, and I believe we were near 40, that it made me loath my
company and victuals, and a very poor dinner it was too.'</p>

<p>"Opposite this tavern people generally left their boats to shoot the
bridge, walking round to Billingsgate, where they would reenter them."&mdash;Hotten's
<i>History of Signboards</i>, p. 204.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>. <i>Saynt Iulyans in Thystellworth parish.</i> 'Thistleworth, see
Isleworth,' says Walker's Gazetteer, ed. 1801. That there might well
have been a St Julyan's Inn there we learn from the following extract:</p>

<p>"St. Julian, the patron of travellers, wandering minstrels, boatmen,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
&amp;c., was a very common inn sign, because he was supposed to provide
good lodgings for such persons. Hence two St. Julian's crosses, in
saltier, are in chief of the innholders' arms, and the old motto was:&mdash;'When
I was harbourless, ye lodged me.' This benevolent attention to
travellers procured him the epithet of 'the good herbergeor,' and in
France '<i>bon herbet</i>.' His legend in a MS., Bodleian, 1596, fol. 4, alludes
to this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Therefore yet to this day, thei that over lond wende,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They biddeth Seint Julian, anon, that gode herborw he hem sende;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Seint Julianes Pater Noster ofte seggeth also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his faders soule, and his moderes, that he hem bring therto.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

common field, extending between Chesterton and Cambridge, near the
little brook Sture, for about half a mile square, is noted for its fair, which
is kept annually on September 19th, and continues a fortnight. It is
surpassed by few fairs in Great Britain, or even in Europe, for traffic,
though of late it is much lessened. The booths are placed in rows like
streets, by the name[s] of which they are called, as Cheapside, &amp;c., and
are filled with all sorts of trades. The Duddery, an area of 80 or 100
yards square, resembles Blackwell Hall. Large commissions are negotiated
here for all parts of England in <i>cheese</i>, woolen goods, wool,
leather, hops, upholsterers' and ironmongers' ware, &amp;c. &amp;c. Sometimes
50 hackney coaches from London, ply morning and night, to and from
Cambridge, as well as all the towns round, and the very barns and
stables are turned into inns for the accommodation of the poorer people.
After the wholesale business is over, the country gentry generally flock
in, laying out their money in stage-plays, taverns, music-houses, toys,
puppet-shows, &amp;c., and the whole concludes with a day for the sale of
horses. This fair is under the jurisdiction of the University of Cambridge.&mdash;<i>Walker's

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
